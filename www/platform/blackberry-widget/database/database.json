There are at least four reasons why a nurse should advocate for a trial of heat or cold:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>it works well for some patients.</li>\r\n    <li>it works quickly.</li>\r\n    <li>adverse effects are virtually non-existent.</li>\r\n    <li>it can provide some patients/families with an important sense of control over the relief of pain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Rationale for treatment:</b> Well-controlled research is lacking, however the premise is that applying heat to skin will increase blood flow and reduce neurotransmitters, which sensitize pain nerve fibres. Heat may compete for nerve transmission with pain and therefore, in the brain there is a perception of heat and a reduced perception of pain.</p>\r\n<p>Cold works through a similar pathway as heat, competing for nerve transmission. It creates numbness in the area of pain and may be especially helpful when the pain has a burning quality.</p>\r\n<p><b>Nursing Role:</b> Assess for prior use of heat or cold. Remember that some patients may think that you are &ldquo;trivializing&rdquo; their pain. You need to be able to describe the scientific rationale to encourage patients with even severe pain on large doses of medication to try heat or cold as an adjunct to their pain management. Heat and cold can be used in children older than six months of age.</p>\r\n<p><b>Contraindications:</b> <i>Avoid use of heat in following situations:</i></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>any area that is bleeding.</li>\r\n    <li>any area with decreased feeling.</li>\r\n    <li>any injury within the first 24 hours.</li>\r\n    <li>if the person is using any menthol-containing products (Vicks, Ben Gay \tetc.).</li>\r\n    <li>within a site of radiation therapy while receiving radiation - may use on this area five days after completing treatment, provided that the skin is not flaky, red or tender.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><i>Avoid use of cold in the following situations:</i></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>any area with poor circulation (diabetic feet).</li>\r\n    <li>within a site of radiation therapy while receiving radiation &ndash; may use on \tthis area five days after completing treatment, provided that the skin is not flaky, red or tender.</li>\r\n    <li>on a wound in the healing phase.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Application of Heat or Cold:</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Heat can be obtained from a variety of sources including heating pad, hot water bottle, topical ointment.</li>\r\n    <li>Use low to medium setting to avoid burns.</li>\r\n    <li>Placement is usually over painful site. When this is not possible (too painful, open wound) other options include:\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>above the site.</li>\r\n        <li>below the site.</li>\r\n        <li>prevent direct contact with heat/cold source on the skin.</li>\r\n        <li>on the opposite side of the body (e.g. pain on right hip, place on left hip).<br />\r\n        <font color=\"#006666\">Adapted from: Ferrell, B. &amp; Rhiner, M. (1993).<i>Managing cancer pain at home</i>. Duarte, CA: City of Hope National Medical Centre.</font></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Prevent direct contact with heat/cold source on the skin.</li>\r\n    <li>Heating pad placed on a child should be monitored every five minutes and the child should not be left unattended.</li>\r\n    <li>Cold can be enhanced by using it in conjunction with menthol-containing products (eg. A535&reg; with ice bag over top).</li>\r\n    <li>When using a topical ointment, test the skin with a small amount of product to check for allergic reaction prior to using it on the painful site.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Relaxation &amp; Imagery</font></h4>\r\n<p>Relaxation may be appropriate for almost any type of pain with a goal of reducing muscle tension and anxiety. It may also be used in children of 7 years and older. Patients who are already tense and in pain may benefit from simple relaxation centred on slow, deep breathing. Progressive muscle relaxation in which the patient uses isometric exercise to systematically relax muscles from head to foot may also be helpful.<br />\r\nLengthy relaxation techniques are enhanced by a quiet environment and having the patient in a comfortable, well supported position. Listening to a taped relaxation session may help the patient to focus more easily, and become less distracted by their pain.<br />\r\nChildren over 5 years old can usually participate in guided imagery. Imagination is spontaneous and natural for children. They are able to focus easily, thus taking their attention away from their pain. However, caution should be used in using relaxation and imagery techniques in patients who are either:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>confused.</li>\r\n    <li>drowsy.</li>\r\n    <li>have a poor grasp of the language of the relaxation therapist.</li>\r\n    <li>have a previous history of significant psychiatric history, such as having \thallucinations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Distraction</font></h4>\r\n<p>Distraction is another pain reducing technique used in children. The idea is to divert the child&rsquo;s attention by actively involving him in the performance of a distracting task that is interesting and more pleasant than the painful procedure. He can choose anything of interest such as blowing bubbles, a special book, a musical toy, a magical wand (Kleiber et al., 1999).</p>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Other Therapies</font></h4>\r\n<p>Recognize that complementary therapies such as therapeutic touch, massage, reflexology,</p>\r\n<p>Reiki and aromatherapy may be useful non-pharmacological adjuncts to pain management. These modalities should be administered by individuals with training in their application.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\">Used with the permission of the Canadian Association of Nurses in Oncology.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","taxonomy":{"1":{"tid":"1","vid":"1","name":"Assessment and Management of Pain","description":"This will include all pages that are in the Assessment and Management of Pain Guideline.","weight":"0"},"5":{"tid":"5","vid":"2","name":"At Point of Care","description":"All of the point of care page content.","weight":"2"}},"changed":"1269538437"},"timestamp":"1269538437"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=8"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Pain Assessment tools for Neonates, Infant and Children","body":"<p><meta content=\"text/html;

However, there are some guiding principles that nurses and other healthcare professionals will use to help you, no matter which type of pain you are experiencing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Pain is unique and different for each individual regardless of age or special needs &ndash;</li>\r\n    <li>Pain is what you say it is.;</li>\r\n    <li>If your pain is not relieved, this needs to be assessed and ways to relieve the pain must be identified.;</li>\r\n    <li>You and your family should be involved in making pain management decisions.;</li>\r\n    <li>Your whole healthcare team should be involved in managing your pain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>The first step is a pain assessment:</strong><br />\r\nYou are the best person to describe your pain. However, if you are not able to speak for yourself, your family should be involved in the pain assessment. When nurses are assessing your pain, you may be asked the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Where is your pain? Is there more than one place where you are feeling pain?</li>\r\n    <li>What does your pain feel like? What words would you use to describe your pain (e.g., aching, sharp)?</li>\r\n    <li>What makes your pain feel better or worse?</li>\r\n    <li>Does your pain move anywhere?</li>\r\n    <li>How is the pain affecting your activities?</li>\r\n    <li>When does your pain start? How long does it last? How often does it occur?</li>\r\n    <li>How would you rate your pain using a 0-10 scale? (A scale may have numbers, or may include words such as &lsquo;no pain&rsquo; to &lsquo;worst pain&rsquo;, or pictures of faces to help you describe your pain).</li>\r\n    <li>How much pain are you experiencing when resting and when you are active? (using a 0-10 scale)</li>\r\n    <li>What medications are you taking? What dose? How often? How long have you been taking them?</li>\r\n    <li>How much are they helping (using a 0-10 scale) to relieve your pain?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>What happens next?</strong><br />\r\nThe answers to these questions, along with information from a physical exam and tests (e.g., x-rays) will provide you and your healthcare providers with information to develop a plan to manage your pain. Your plan may include medication and other things such as exercise and heat/cold therapy. As part of your care, you should be asked on a regular basis to describe your pain, and whether the pain is improving. Your plan will be changed as necessary.</p>\r\n<p>Speak to your nurse, doctor or other healthcare professional when you first start feeling pain, and get involved in your (or your family member&rsquo;s) pain management plan! It is often easier to control pain in its early stages before it becomes severe. Remember, you have the right to the best pain relief possible.</p>\r\n<p>This information fact sheet is developed as a supplement to the RNAO Nursing Best Practice Guideline document for nurses.

Lifetime recurrence is quite high: 50 % who have had one episode will relapse; 70 % who have had two episodes will relapse; and 90 % who have had three episodes will relapse. Therefore, continuation with treatment to avoid relapse is important (Centre for Evidence-Based Mental Health, 1998; National Advisory Committee on Health and Disability, 1996).</dd>\r\n    <p><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></p>\r\n    <dt><strong>Secondary Prevention (also called intervention)</strong><a name=\"term15\">&nbsp;</a></dt>\r\n    <dd>Preventive measures that are implemented after suicidal tendencies or high risk conditions have become apparent.

Wandering can also be managed through &quot;collusion&quot;, walking with resident, then you or other staff, &quot;invite&quot; him/her to return to ward/facility.</li>\r\n    <li>Have a plan to deal with disruptive behaviour; keep your hands in sight; avoid &quot;threatening&quot; gestures or movement; remove potentially harmful objects from client, room, and the caregiver's person. Bear in mind that these episodes may not be remembered by clients. If they are remembered, often they are the cause of embarrassment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\">Category of Support</font><a name=\"category4\">&nbsp;</a><br />\r\n<b>Sound and Light</b></p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><b>Interventions</b></font></p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>Keep the environment calm and quiet with adequate, but soft, indirect light and limit noise levels.</li>\r\n            <li>Provide glasses and hearing aides to maximize sensory perception.</li>\r\n            <li>Consider the use of night lights to combat nighttime confusion.</li>\r\n            <li>Use music which has an individual significance to the confused and agitated client to prevent the increase in or decrease agitated behaviours.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p><font color=\"#006666\"><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></font></p>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <p><font color=\"#006666\">Category of Support</font><a name=\"category5\">&nbsp;</a><br />\r\n    <b>Psychosocial</b></p>\r\n    <p><font color=\"#006666\"><b>Interventions</b></font></p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>Encourage clients to be involved in, and to control, as much of their care as possible.</li>\r\n            <li>Be sure to allow them to set their own limits, and do not force clients to do things they do not want to, as this is likely to cause disruptive behaviours.Reminiscing can also help increase self-esteem.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p><font color=\"#006666\"><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></font></p>\r\n        <hr />\r\n        <p><font color=\"#006666\">Category of Support</font><a name=\"category6\">&nbsp;</a><br />\r\n        <b>Social Interaction</b></p>\r\n        <p><font color=\"#006666\"><b>Interventions</b></font></p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li>Encourage family and friends to visit, but visits work best when scheduled, and numbers of visitors and lengths of visits should be limited so as not to overwhelm the client.</li>\r\n                <li>Consider involving the client in programming so as to decrease his/her social isolation (physiotherapy and occupational therapy may be potential options).</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <p><font color=\"#006666\"><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></font></p>\r\n            <hr />\r\n            <p><font color=\"#006666\">Category of Support</font><a name=\"category7\">&nbsp;</a><br />\r\n            <b>Other Interventions</b></p>\r\n            <p><font color=\"#006666\"><b>Interventions</b></font></p>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>Consult with a Nurse Specialist/Geriatrics or Psychiatry for severe disruptive behaviours, psychosis, or if symptoms do not resolve in 48 hours.</li>\r\n                    <li>Provide reassurance to clients both during and after acute confusion/delirious episodes.</li>\r\n                    <li>Acknowledge client's feelings/fears.</li>\r\n                    <li>Allow clients to engage in activities that limit anxiety.</li>\r\n                    <li>Avoid demanding abstract thinking for delirious clients, keep tasks concrete.</li>\r\n                    <li>Limit choices, and offer decision-making only when clients are capable of making these judgments.</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n                <p><font color=\"#006666\"><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></font></p>\r\n                <hr />\r\n                <p><font color=\"#006666\">Category of Support</font><a name=\"category8\">&nbsp;</a><br />\r\n                <b>Behavioural Management Interventions</b> (for disruptive behaviours seen as part of Acute Confusion</p>\r\n                <p><font color=\"#006666\"><b>Interventions</b></font></p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Changing staffing patterns or altering care routine (including amount/type of touching).</li>\r\n                        <li>One to one supervision.</li>\r\n                        <li>Pay attention to clients.</li>\r\n                        <li>Talk with/counsel clients; give verbal reprimands.</li>\r\n                        <li>Ignore.</li>\r\n                        <li>Removal of client from the situation; time out; seclusion/isolation.

This is a physical problem, not a psychological one. Delirium usually comes on over a few days and, with treatment, it will often improve.</p>\r\n<h2>What Causes Delirium?</h2>\r\n<p>A physical illness can cause delirium, particularly if there are changes in the chemistry of the blood, or if dehydration or infection exist. Medications, although necessary to treat illness or provide pain control and symptom relief, also may contribute to the development of delirium. Anyone can become delirious under certain circumstances of illness.</p>\r\n<h2>What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Delirium?</h2>\r\n<p>A sick person may show some or all of the following symptoms of delirium:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Saying things that are all mixed up;</li>\r\n    <li>Not knowing where they are;</li>\r\n    <li>Seeing or hearing things which are not real;</li>\r\n    <li>Being restless and unable to stay still;</li>\r\n    <li>Climbing out of bed; and</li>\r\n    <li>Having restless spells that alternate with being drowsy and sleepier than usual.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The sick person may seem irritable and angry. They may not be able to understand when people try to reassure them that everything is all right. They also may be irritable with nurses and other staff. They may be somewhat paranoid and suspicious, thinking that everyone is against them or that there is a plot going on. Some delirious people may want to call the police to get help.</p>\r\n<p>One of the best ways to understand delirium, and what a delirious sick person is going through, is to imagine what it is like to be in the middle of a very mixed up and strange dream or nightmare. The difference with a delirious person is that they are having these experiences while they are awake. 131</p>\r\n<h2>How is Delirium Treated?</h2>\r\n<p>First, doctors will try to find the most likely cause of the delirium. Sometimes this is a puzzle, and, often, no single cause can be pinpointed. The doctor may make changes to the medications the delirious person is taking. Treatment may also include measures like an intravenous (IV) to administer fluid that can correct chemical problems in the blood and treat infection. The doctor also will order some medications to treat the delirium itself, and may order sedatives to help the delirious person stay calm.</p>\r\n<h2>What Can Family and Friends Do to Help?</h2>\r\n<p>There are some things that you can do to help if someone you care about is going through a period of delirium when ill.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Talk with the healthcare team about any signs of delirium you see developing in your loved one.</li>\r\n    <li>Be reassured that, with treatment, the delirium should go away, or will be greatly reduced.</li>\r\n    <li>Try to use a calm, soft voice when speaking to your loved one or with others nearby.</li>\r\n    <li>Try placing a soft light in the room at night so your loved one can see where he or she is. Delirious people often are more restless and agitated at night because they feel disoriented.</li>\r\n    <li>Remind them where they are. If they are in the hospital, try placing a poster-type sign at the foot of the bed with large letters saying, for example, &ldquo;You are in the ____Hospital on____ Street in ____(city).&rdquo;</li>\r\n    <li>Remind the person of the date, time and season. This will help them stay connected.</li>\r\n    <li>Gently reassure them that they are safe and that everything is all right.</li>\r\n    <li>Consider developing a schedule of family and close friends to stay with the person around the clock so they will not be alone. This will help them feel secure and less frightened, and also will help maintain their own safety if they are restless or agitated. Sometimes hospitals have volunteers who can help with this. Some families will hire a healthcare aid for the night-time hours. This gives peace of mind to the family, and will allow you to get some needed sleep at home while knowing that your loved one is not alone.</li>\r\n    <li>Bring familiar photos into the room and play favourite music softly in the background.</li>\r\n    <li>Consider limiting the number of visitors who come to see your loved one until the delirium goes away.</li>\r\n    <li>Remember to look after yourself. Try to get some rest and relaxation. Go out for short walks, have a massage, or do other relaxing and restoring things. Remember to eat, drink lots of fluids to keep up your energy, and try not to drink too much coffee and other caffeinated beverages. It is not easy to be with a delirious person, even though you may understand the nature of the problem. It may help to share your thoughts and feelings with someone. Ask to see a palliative-care team, hospital chaplain or social worker for supportive counselling.</li>\r\n    <li>Try not to take some of the things that your loved one says to heart. Remember that delirious people are not themselves. In fact, they are not likely to remember very much about the period of time that they suffer from delirium, and they will not remember what they said, what they did, or what happened.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Prepared by Dr. Elizabeth Latimer, Professor, Department of Family Medicine, McMaster University and Palliative Care Physician, Hamilton Health Sciences.

They can develop in a very short time period and take longer to heal. They may have a huge impact on your every day life, as normal activities can be restricted while the ulcer heals. Healing these ulcers can be costly to you and the healthcare system. <br />\r\nIf you spend long periods of time in a bed, chair or wheelchair and have lost your feeling in your lower body, you maybe at increased risk of getting pressure ulcers. In most cases, pressure ulcers can be prevented. If they do occur, they can be healed.</p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>How do pressure ulcers develop? </strong></em></font> There are a number of risk factors that lead to pressure ulcers. Some of the factors include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Limitation in movement (e.g., paralysis, acute/chronic illness or surgery).</li>\r\n    <li>Incontinence (loss of bowel and/or bladder control).</li>\r\n    <li>Not having a well-balanced diet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>Facts about pressure ulcers: </strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The first sign of a pressure ulcer is reddened skin on fair skinned individuals or purplish/bluish discolouration in darker individuals. It may not be painful.</li>\r\n    <li>A very ill person may develop a pressure ulcer quickly.</li>\r\n    <li>Persons who are confined to a bed may develop ulcers on areas that they lie on such as the tailbone, buttocks (bottom), heels, hips, ankles, shoulder blades, back of the head, ears, elbows and knees. Pressure ulcers may also develop on the buttocks (bottom) of persons who are sitting in a chair or wheelchair for a long time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>What can you do to prevent or reduce your risk of developing pressure ulcers? <br />\r\nIf you are confined to bed:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Remember that you can best help yourself. Change your position frequently by turning your body. Do this at least every 2 hours. If you cannot move on your own, have someone assist you.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid lying on your hip. Instead, turn to your side and support yourself with pillows.</li>\r\n    <li>Use pillows or foam wedges to avoid contact between bony areas. Use devices such as heel protectors that will reduce pressure on the heels and ankles.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>If you are confined to chair or wheelchair:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Shift your weight every 15 minutes. If you cannot shift your weight, have someone move you at least every hour.</li>\r\n    <li>Do not create your own cushion (e.g., donut type devices) as it will likely just move pressure to a new area. Instead, use pressure-reducing devices. There are many pressure-reducing products designed for seating surfaces to choose from. An occupational therapist or a physiotherapist can suggest an appropriate seating device based on your needs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>If you are a caregiver for someone who is at risk of developing pressure ulcer,here are some helpful suggestions for you: </strong></em></font><br />\r\nUse lifting devices to move the person during transfer and position changes. Keep the skin and bony areas from rubbing on surfaces. Talk to a nurse, occupational therapist, physiotherapist or doctor regarding the use of transfer techniques, and how to obtain lifting devices and pressure reducing/relieving devices. <strong>(Caution:The use of pressure reducing/relieving devices does not substitute for an appropriate turning schedule.)</strong> If pain is an issue discuss with the nurse or doctor about ways to manage the pain.</p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>More Tips:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Use a mild cleansing product that is pH balanced when bathing and after an episode of incontinence. Use a product which is both a moisturizer and skin barrier protection against moisture to re-hydrate dry skin and to improve resistance to injury.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid massaging bony areas.</li>\r\n    <li>Eat a balanced diet. Eat fruits, vegetables and foods high in protein and calories. Drink plenty of fluids. If you cannot handle a balanced diet, ask your nurse, doctor or dietitian about nutritional supplements. Consult your doctor about the use of multivitamin tablets.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><strong><em>What can you do if you develop a pressure ulcer?</em></strong></font><br />\r\nWith proper treatment, most pressure ulcers will heal. Healing of pressure ulcers depends on your general health, diet, relieving pressure on the ulcer and careful cleaning and dressing of the wound. Healing wounds also requires a team effort that includes healthcare experts, you and your caregiver. The treatment plan will be based on the results of a wound assessment, a physical exam and health history.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","taxonomy":{"9":{"tid":"9","vid":"1","name":"Risk Assessment and Prevention of Pressure Ulcers","description":"Pressure Ulcer BPG","weight":"0"},"7":{"tid":"7","vid":"2","name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content.","weight":"4"}},"changed":"1260898988"},"timestamp":"1260898988"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=73"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Background - Constipation in the Older Adults","body":"<ul>\r\n    <li><b>Constipation is a frequent health concern </b>for elderly persons and their care providers across the continuum of healthcare.</li>\r\n    <li>There is an increasing prevalence of constipation with age, particularly after age 70.

In most cases, constipation is temporary and not serious.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Fortunately, there are many ways to prevent constipation. Understanding the reasons for constipation is the first step. If you have chronic constipation, talk to your nurse, doctor or nutritionist.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">Here are some helpful hints.</font></strong></em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Drink sufficient fluids. Aim for 1&frac12;-2 litres of fluids daily (6 to 8, eight ounce glasses).</li>\r\n    <li>Reduce caffeinated (coffee, tea, some soft drinks) and alcoholic beverages whenever possible as they actually cause you to lose fluids.</li>\r\n    <li>Eat adequate dietary fiber in combination with a good fluid intake. Please note that dietary intake of fiber should be gradually increased once you are consistently taking 1&frac12;litres of fluid daily. A high fiber diet is not recommended in persons who are immobile (bedridden) or persons who do not drink at least 1&frac12;litres of fluids per day. Adequate dietary fibre can be achieved by consuming about 2 to 3 servings of grains and about 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Examples of dietary fiber include wheat bran, whole cereals such as wheat, rice, barley, rye, millets; fruits like mango and guava; and leafy vegetables such as cabbage, lettuce and celery. Fiber supplements in powder, tablet or granular form are also available. Consult your pharmacist.</li>\r\n    <li>Use routine consistent toileting each day based on your urge to have a bowel movement. Use a squat position to facilitate the bowel movement process.</li>\r\n    <li>Exercise such as walking (15 to 20 minutes once or twice a day) can stimulate the bowels.</li>\r\n    <li>If you are unable to walk or are bedridden, there are numerous exercises that you can do. Examples of such exercises include flattening the low back arch by tightening the abdominal muscles (pelvic tilt), rolling bent knees side to side twisting at the waist (low trunk rotation) and single leg lifts. Before starting on an exercise program, consult with a health care professionalc(your doctor or nurse).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","taxonomy":{"10":{"tid":"10","vid":"1","name":"Prevention of Constipation in the Older Population","description":"Constipation BPG","weight":"0"},"7":{"tid":"7","vid":"2","name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content.","weight":"4"}},"changed":"1260416391"},"timestamp":"1260416391"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=82"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Educational Resources","body":"<p>The following websites provide information on constipation.

Behavioural interventions for urinary incontinence seek to change the way a person reacts to urine loss (Lyons &amp; Pringle Specht, 1999)<i>.</i>&nbsp; Other examples of behavioural responses to urinary incontinence include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The application of an incontinence product to collect and store urine until a time at which the urine can conveniently be disposed.</li>\r\n    <li>Emptying of the bladder prior to urine loss.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Prompted voiding differs from the examples above, in that it is the care provider&rsquo;s, rather than the incontinent individual&rsquo;s, response to urinary incontinence that is changed. Rather than relying on an incontinence aid or clothing, the caregiver will intervene prior to the undesired bladder voiding. An individualized prompted voiding schedule is determined using a 3-day voiding record that is based on the person&rsquo;s normal pattern of voiding and/or incontinence. Prompted voiding is used for the treatment of urinary incontinence in persons with physical and/or cognitive deficits, requiring timely reminders to toilet from caregivers. This intervention has been used successfully to treat urinary incontinence in acute and long-term care, as well as in home care settings (Lyons &amp; Pringle Specht, 1999).</p>\r\n<p>Each time prompted voiding is initiated, the care provider uses three primary behaviours:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> This involves asking the incontinent individual, at regular intervals, if he or she needs to use the toilet. The care provider may look for behaviours that the client needs to be toileted (e.g., restlessness, agitation, disrobing), and take the client to the toilet at regular intervals specific to their schedule, rather than routinely every two hours.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Prompting:</strong> This process includes prompting the person to use the toilet at regular intervals, and encourages the maintenance of bladder control between prompted voiding sessions.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Praising:</strong> This important step is the positive reinforcement of dryness and appropriate toileting, and is the response from the care provider to the individual&rsquo;s success with maintaining bladder control.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","taxonomy":{"3":{"tid":"3","vid":"2","name":"Pre-reading","description":"All of the pre-reading content pages.","weight":"0"},"11":{"tid":"11","vid":"1","name":"Promoting Continence Using Prompted Voiding","description":"Continence PDA","weight":"0"}},"changed":"1260845466"},"timestamp":"1260845466"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=84"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Promoting Continence Recommendations","body":"<p><strong>&nbsp;1.0</strong> Obtain a history of the client&rsquo;s incontinence. </p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;2.0</strong> Gather information on:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The amount, type and time of daily fluid intake, paying particular attention to the intake amount of caffeine and alcohol.</li>\r\n    <li>The frequency, nature and consistency of bowel movements.</li>\r\n    <li>Any relevant medical or surgical history which may be related to the incontinence problem, such as but not limited to diabetes, stroke, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, heart failure, recurrent urinary tract infections or previous bladder surgery.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;3.0</strong> Review the client&rsquo;s medications to identify those which may have an impact on the incontinence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;4.0</strong> Identify the client&rsquo;s functional and cognitive ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;5.0</strong> Identify attitudinal and environmental barriers to successful toileting.&nbsp; Barriers include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Proximity and availability of the nearest bathroom;</li>\r\n    <li>Accessibility of commode;</li>\r\n    <li>Satisfactory lighting;</li>\r\n    <li>Use of restraints;</li>\r\n    <li>Staff expectation that incontinence is an inevitable consequence of aging; and</li>\r\n    <li>Staff belief that few interventions exist to promote continence.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp; 6.0</strong> Check urine to determine if infection is present.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; <strong>7.0</strong> Determine how the client perceives their urinary incontinence and if they will benefit from prompted voiding.

Support systems must be assessed and accessed for every person in crisis.</p>\r\n<p>These include family support and accessibility, financial resources, and community and professional support networks. The strength of the client&rsquo;s support systems significantly influences the outcomes of successful crisis resolution. Do not assume that families are always supportive of clients.</p>\r\n<p>Some questions for assessing the client&rsquo;s support systems include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Does the client live alone or with others?</li>\r\n    <li>Who is the client close to?</li>\r\n    <li>Who is important for the client?</li>\r\n    <li>What supports have been helpful in the past and are these supports available now?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Because multiple studies have shown that what appear to be psychiatric symptoms are often caused by medical problems, best practice recommends a medical/psychiatric history that includes a mental status exam to be implemented by nurses.

In fact, 6 in 10 people with asthma have poor asthma control, and as a result restrict their everyday activities and suffer needlessly. The goal of asthma care is to provide you with freedom from symptoms and a normal, active lifestyle.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What is asthma?</font></strong></em> Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways &ndash; common symptoms include shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing and/or coughing. Asthma attacks may begin suddenly, or symptoms may slowly get worse over a period of time.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What causes asthma?</font></strong></em> The exact cause of asthma is not known. However, there are several factors that may play a part in the development of asthma. These include a tendency to have allergic reactions to things in your environment, a family history of asthma or allergies, and exposure to second hand smoke. Things that can trigger an asthma attack include irritants such as tobacco smoke, pollution, and exercise. Allergies to substances such as pollen, moulds, dust mites, pet dander and certain foods can trigger an attack, as can viral infections, colds, and certain drugs.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Assessing asthma control:</strong>You can expect your nurse or other healthcare provider to ask you some basic questions, such as: <em>&ldquo;Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have asthma?&rdquo;</em>or <em>&ldquo;Have you ever used a puffer/inhaler or asthma medication for breathing problems?&rdquo;</em>.Your level of asthma control should be assessed if you have <br />\r\nbeen identified as having asthma (or are suspected of having asthma). <br />\r\nGood asthma control is achieved when:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>you are using your &ldquo;short-acting&rdquo; puffer less than 4 times per week (unless for exercise);</li>\r\n    <li>you are having daytime asthma symptoms less than four times per week;</li>\r\n    <li>you are having night time asthma symptoms less than once per week;</li>\r\n    <li>you have normal physical activity levels;</li>\r\n    <li>you have no absence from work or school related to your asthma; and</li>\r\n    <li>asthma attacks are infrequent and mild.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Asthma medications:</strong> You should anticipate that your nurse or other healthcare provider will discuss your asthma medications with you to make sure that you understand their purpose and use. You should also expect that you will be asked to demonstrate your puffer/inhaler technique to make sure that you are using your delivery device properly. If you need help in using your puffer/inhaler, ask your nurse for assistance.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Your Asthma Action Plan:</strong> If you have asthma, you should have a personal asthma action plan written by you and your asthma care providers. This plan will help you to monitor your asthma control and make changes to how you manage your asthma. Often asthma action plans use the image of a traffic light &ndash; a green, a yellow, and a red zone. The green zone describes good asthma control, and a &ldquo;go ahead&rdquo; with current therapy. The yellow zone describes a decrease in asthma control. In response to this loss of control, suggestions may be made to adjust medications and/or seek medical assistance. The red zone describes asthma that is out of control and severe enough to need urgent medical care.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Regular follow-up care:</strong> A key part of your asthma care includes follow-up visits with a healthcare provider who monitors your asthma. Your doctor may refer you to an asthma specialist if your diagnosis is in doubt, or if your asthma is out of control. There are also community resources for individuals with asthma that provide education and information that may be helpful for you in managing your asthma.

In human plasma, the concentration of dissolved particles is about 290 x 103 M, so its osmolality is 290 mOsm/L (Stranz, 2002).</p>\r\n<p>Separate solutions containing the same amount of particles are called iso-osmotic. The term isotonic is used interchangeably with the term iso-osmotic. Normal saline is iso-osmotic/isotonic with blood and the venous endothelium. Solutions containing fewer particles (lower osmolality) than normal saline are called hypotonic. Administration of hypotonic solutions results in fluid moving into the more concentrated venous endothelial cells and blood cells.</p>\r\n<p>Solutions containing more particles (higher osmolality) are called hypertonic. When hypertonic solutions are administered, they draw fluid from the endothelium and blood cells, resulting in the cells shrinking and being more susceptible to damage (Stranz, 2002).</p>\r\n<h2>Vesicant Drugs</h2>\r\n<p>The following list includes some commonly administered vesicant drugs capable of causing injury when the drug escapes from the intended vascular pathway into surrounding tissue (INS, 2000).

They can develop in a very short time period and take longer to heal. They may have a huge impact on your every day life, as normal activities can be restricted while the ulcer heals. Healing these ulcers can be costly to you and the healthcare system.</p>\r\n<p>If you spend long periods of time in a bed, chair or wheelchair and have lost your feeling in your lower body, you maybe at increased risk of getting pressure ulcers. In most cases, pressure ulcers can be prevented. If they do occur, they can be healed.</p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>How do pressure ulcers develop?</strong></em></font> <br />\r\nThere are a number of risk factors that lead to pressure ulcers. Some of the factors include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Limitation in movement (e.g., paralysis, acute/chronic illness or surgery).</li>\r\n    <li>Incontinence (loss of bowel and/or bladder control).</li>\r\n    <li>Not having a well-balanced diet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>Facts about pressure ulcers:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The first sign of a pressure ulcer is reddened skin on fair skinned individuals or purplish/bluish discolouration in darker individuals. It may not be painful.</li>\r\n    <li>A very ill person may develop a pressure ulcer quickly.</li>\r\n    <li>Persons who are confined to a bed may develop ulcers on areas that they lie on such as the tailbone, buttocks (bottom), heels, hips, ankles, shoulder blades, back of the head, ears, elbows and knees. Pressure ulcers may also develop on the buttocks (bottom) of persons who are sitting in a chair or wheelchair for a long time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>What can you do to prevent or reduce your risk of developing pressure ulcers? If you are confined to bed:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Remember that you can best help yourself. Change your position frequently by turning your body. Do this at least every 2 hours. If you cannot move on your own, have someone assist you.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid lying on your hip. Instead, turn to your side and support yourself</li>\r\n    <li>with pillows.</li>\r\n    <li>Use pillows or foam wedges to avoid contact between bony areas. Use devices such as heel protectors that will reduce pressure on the heels and ankles. November 2003</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><strong><em>If you are confined to chair or wheelchair:</em></strong></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Shift your weight every 15 minutes. If you cannot shift your weight, have someone move you at least every hour.</li>\r\n    <li>Do not create your own cushion (e.g., donut type devices) as it will likely just move pressure to a new area. Instead, use pressure-reducing devices. There are many pressure-reducing products designed for seating surfaces to choose from. An occupational therapist or physiotherapist can suggest an appropriate seating device based on your needs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><strong><em>If you are a caregiver for someone who is at risk of developing pressure ulcer,here are some helpful suggestions for you:</em></strong></font> Use lifting devices to move the person during transfer and position changes. Keep the skin and bony areas from rubbing on surfaces. Talk to a nurse, occupational therapist, physiotherapist or doctor regarding the use of transfer techniques, and how to obtain lifting devices and pressure reducing/relieving devices. <em><strong>(Caution:The use of pressure reducing/relieving devices does not substitute for an appropriate turning schedule.)</strong></em> If pain is an issue discuss with the nurse or doctor about ways to manage the pain.</p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>More Tips:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Use a mild cleansing product that is pH balanced when bathing and after an episode of incontinence. Use a product which is both a moisturizer and skin barrier protection against moisture to re-hydrate dry skin and to improve resistance to injury.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid massaging bony areas.</li>\r\n    <li>Eat a balanced diet. Eat fruits, vegetables and foods high in protein and calories. Drink plenty of fluids. If you cannot handle a balanced diet, ask your nurse, doctor or dietitian about nutritional supplements. Consult your doctor about the use of multivitamin tablets.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>What can you do if you develop a pressure ulcer?</strong></em></font>\r\nWith proper treatment, most pressure ulcers will heal. Healing of pressure ulcers depends on your general health, diet, relieving pressure on the ulcer and careful cleaning and dressing of the wound. Healing wounds also requires a team effort that includes healthcare experts, you and your caregiver. The treatment plan will be based on the results of a wound assessment, a physical exam and health history.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","taxonomy":{"16":{"tid":"16","vid":"1","name":"Assessment and Management of Stage I to IV Pressure Ulcers","description":"Pressure Ulcer Assessment BPG","weight":"0"},"7":{"tid":"7","vid":"2","name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content.","weight":"4"}},"changed":"1259701208"},"timestamp":"1259701208"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=157"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Definition ","body":"<p>Client centred care is an approach in which clients are viewed as whole persons; it is not merely about delivering services where the client is located.

Some of these feelings are joy and excitement, or guilt and sadness. This is quite normal after such an important event! Sometimes unhappy feelings become so difficult that a mother feels overwhelmed and out of control. If this happens, a woman may be suffering from postpartum depression and anxiety.</p>\r\n<h4>What are Postpartum Depression and Anxiety?</h4>\r\n<p>They are emotional problems which may happen to a mother after her baby is born. One mother in five experiences depression and anxiety after birth. These problems are more common than many people think. Every mother is different and may have different symptoms. These symptoms may happen shortly after birth or many months later.</p>\r\n<h4>What are the Symptoms?</h4>\r\n<p>Most women feel:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Sad</li>\r\n    <li>Angry</li>\r\n    <li>Guilty</li>\r\n    <li>Alone</li>\r\n    <li>Worried</li>\r\n    <li>Inadequate</li>\r\n    <li>Irritable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other feelings are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Wanting to run away</li>\r\n    <li>Not being able to cope</li>\r\n    <li>Exhaustion &ndash; not being able to sleep even when the baby sleeps</li>\r\n    <li>Isolation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A mother who is new to Canada may also feel:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Lonely because her family and friends are far away</li>\r\n    <li>Unfamiliar with the Canadian healthcare system</li>\r\n    <li>The absence of familiar comforts, traditions and rituals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These feelings last for two weeks or more, and do not go away by themselves. This is a different situation than the &ldquo;baby blues&rdquo; (fatigue and tearfulness). The &ldquo;baby blues&rdquo; may appear shortly after birth and disappear on their own. A mother may have &ldquo;scary&rdquo; thoughts of harming the baby or herself. These thoughts may increase if the mother is overtired or stressed. A doctor should be consulted.</p>\r\n<h4>What Causes Postpartum Depression and Anxiety?</h4>\r\n<p>The causes are not completely understood. Some causes may be:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Hormonal and chemical changes in the body</li>\r\n    <li>Stress and lack of support</li>\r\n    <li>Adjusting to motherhood</li>\r\n    <li>A history of emotional, physical or sexual abuse may be a factor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Why Do So Many Women Suffer in Silence?</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>They may hide their feelings.</li>\r\n    <li>They may feel ashamed and guilty.</li>\r\n    <li>Health care professionals may not recognize the depression or anxiety.</li>\r\n    <li>Partners and families may not take the situation seriously.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>What Can Help?</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Speak to a healthcare provider, family member, friend or counsellor.</li>\r\n    <li>Ask for the location of a postpartum support program.</li>\r\n    <li>Make sure that the mother gets enough food and rest.</li>\r\n    <li>Understand that this is not the mother&rsquo;s fault.</li>\r\n    <li>Accept and understand that a new mother cannot do everything.</li>\r\n    <li>Ask for help from others.</li>\r\n    <li>Be willing to try things that may be unfamiliar such as counselling, group support, or medication.</li>\r\n    <li>Take one day at a time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","taxonomy":{"19":{"tid":"19","vid":"1","name":"Interventions for Postpartum Depression","description":"Postpartum Depression BPG","weight":"0"},"7":{"tid":"7","vid":"2","name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content.","weight":"4"}},"changed":"1269961778"},"timestamp":"1269961778"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=186"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Sample Care Pathway","body":"<p><a href=\"http://pda.rnao.ca/sites/pda/files/images/samplcrpth.pdf\">Click here to view</a> or go to the Guideline at<a href=\"http://www.rnao.org/Storage/11/600_BPG_Post_Partum_Depression.pdf\"> www.rnao.org/Storage/11/600_BPG_Post_Partum_Depression.pdf</a> pg. 82 [PDF - 245 KB].</p>","taxonomy":{"19":{"tid":"19","vid":"1","name":"Interventions for Postpartum Depression","description":"Postpartum Depression BPG","weight":"0"},"5":{"tid":"5","vid":"2","name":"At Point of Care","description":"All of the point of care page content.","weight":"2"}},"changed":"1269961588"},"timestamp":"1269961588"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=187"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Additional Resources","body":"<h2>Internet Sources<a name=\"top\"></a></h2>\r\n<p>Depression After Delivery: www.depressionafterdelivery.com</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Provides information and education for women and families affected by postpartum depression.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Helpformom: www.helpformom.ca</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Offers public and professional awareness of postpartum depression along with access to a variety of community agencies in the London, Ontario area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Maternal and Child Health: www.mchlibrary.info/KnowledgePaths/kp_postpartum.html</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Compilation of information, resources, and links for health professionals and consumers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Mood Disorders Society of Canada: www.mooddisorderscanada.ca</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Offers awareness, education, advocacy, and research.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Motherisk: www.motherisk.org</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Professional information about the safety or risk of drugs, chemicals and disease during pregnancy and lactation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Our Sisters&rsquo; Place: www.oursistersplace.ca</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Provides information/support for women with mood disorders related to hormonal changes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Pacific Postpartum Support Society: <a href=\"http://www.postpartum.org\">www.postpartum.org</a></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Offers support and information for women with postpartum depression and their families.

These figures likely underestimate the true prevalence of COPD because a diagnosis is often not made until the patient is over 55 years of age and has advanced changes in the lung tissue.

Dyspnea, the subjective experience of breathlessness (Gift, 1990; 1993; GOLD Scientific Committee, 2003; 2004), is the most disabling symptom of COPD. As a progressive respiratory disorder, COPD is characterized by progressive airway obstruction precipitating ongoing dyspnea and systemic manifestations including peripheral muscle dysfunction, right heart failure, polycythemia and changes in nutritional status.

Exhale during the strenuous part of an activity and use pursed-lip and diaphragmatic breathing.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Eliminate Unnecessary Activities</b>: For instance, use a terry robe after showering to avoid the work of drying yourself, and allow dishes to air dry after washing. Sit for as many activities as possible. Sitting uses 25% less energy than standing.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Get Assistance</b>: Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for assistance when necessary. Some jobs may be too difficult to do alone. Or, there may be a task that you dislike doing, and which someone else may enjoy doing for you. Asking for help does not mean you are dependent; it means you are using your energy to its best advantage.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Organize Your Time</b>: Plan daily and weekly schedules so you are doing the most energy-consuming activities at the time of day or time of week when you have the most energy. Alternate difficult and easy tasks. Take planned rest periods. Keep your schedule flexible and allow for the unexpected.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Organize Your Methods</b>: Repetition of new methods will allow things to become automatic, and the more proficient you are, the more energy you save.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Organize Your Space</b>: Organize your most used items in drawers or shelves that are between waist and shoulder level, so you won&rsquo;t have to stoop or stretch to reach them. Keep items in the area in which they are used, in order to avoid unnecessary walking and carrying.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Pace Yourself</b>: A slow, steady pace consumes less energy. Do one activity at a time and use slow, smooth movements. Rushing only increases discomfort. Be certain to alternate periods of work and rest. Try to plan out your activities in steps, so if you start to get short of breath you can stop and rest when necessary, instead of working faster and harder in order to finish.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Maintain a Good Posture</b>: One of the easiest ways to save energy is to use your body properly. When the body is in proper alignment, less effort is required to maintain that posture. Avoid bending. Avoid lifting. Push, pull or slide instead. If you must lift and carry, lift with your legs, use both hands and carry close to your body. Be certain to choose a work height whereby you can maintain good posture and eliminate strain from any segment of the body. Experimenting at different heights by adjusting either the height of the chair or the work surface is the best method of deciding which height is the most comfortable.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Relax</b>: Relaxation can help restore energy. Sit in a comfortable chair with your back supported, shoulders relaxed, arms resting in your lap with elbows slightly bent and palms up and feet flat on the floor.&nbsp; Concentrate on relaxing your muscles and slowing down your breathing. Remember: tension only uses energy!</li>\r\n    <li><b>Use Proper Equipment</b>: Use the right tool to do the job. For example, use long-handled equipment to avoid reaching or bending, use equipment to stabilize items in order to avoid holding, and use trolleys or bundle buggies to do your carrying.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","taxonomy":{"20":{"tid":"20","vid":"1","name":"Nursing Care of Dyspnea: The 6th Vital Sign in Individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) ","description":"COPD BPG","weight":"0"},"5":{"tid":"5","vid":"2","name":"At Point of Care","description":"All of the point of care page content.","weight":"2"}},"changed":"1260297115"},"timestamp":"1260297115"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=204"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Breathing and Relaxation Techniques ","body":"<h2><a name=\"top\"></a>Control Your Breathing</h2>\r\n<p><b>Remember: </b>Breathlessness on effort is uncomfortable but not in itself harmful or dangerous.

These are different conditions and are not part of normal aging. However, it is hard to recognize the differences in the older adult because many of the symptoms and behaviours can occur together. It is important to realize that you can seek help in recognizing the differences and find suggestions for care.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">Are you or a loved one experiencing the following?</font></strong></em><br />\r\n<strong>Delirium</strong> (acute confusion) is a change in your ability to think clearly, to plan your usual day, to pay attention or to remember a few days or hours ago. It usually happens quite quickly over a short period of time (several hours or days) and is temporary, lasting for a few hours or several weeks. Delirium has many different causes and these may include: severe infections; high fever; lack of fluids; diseases of the kidney or liver; lack of certain vitamins; seizures; lack of oxygen; head injury; reaction to certain medications or alcohol. It can also occur after surgery or sometimes after a fall. A delirious person may be confused about where they are or what time of day or year it is. Things may be seen or heard that are not there. Older people with delirium may have mood swings that can be frightening.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Dementia</strong> is the gradual loss in memory (ability to think, reason, remember and plan) and the ability to carry out one&rsquo;s daily activities. It usually starts slower than delirium, over many months and may appear as a loss in thinking and doing your normal activities. It is different for each person. Aging itself does not cause dementia but it is more common among older adults. One of the most common types of dementia is Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. The symptoms of dementia may include: memory loss that affects daily activities (e.g., dressing, grooming); difficulty performing tasks (e.g., banking, driving, brushing teeth); problem with language, poor or decreased judgment; misplacing things (e.g., &ldquo;someone took them&rdquo;); changes in mood, behaviour and/or personality; disorientation to time and place; getting lost; loss of initiative (e.g., often better if someone tells you what to do); difficulty with balance while walking.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Depression </strong>is the most common mental health concern in the older adults. Depression often occurs at the time of a major life change such as a loss of a spouse. Signs of depression may include: cutting back on enjoyable activities (e.g., losing interest); changes in appetite and weight (e.g., loss of interest in eating or eating more). Changes in sleep pattern (e.g., awake during the night and are not able to fall asleep again) is another warning sign. You may feel a lack of energy or always feel tired, even if you have slept. Depression that is not treated can result in physical illness, substance abuse, loneliness and suicide.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What can you do for yourself,or for someone you know who may be experiencing signs of delirium,dementia or depression?</font></strong> </em><br />\r\nAny older person who shows the signs and symptoms discussed above has the right to a timely and thorough geriatric/mental health evaluation and treatment. <em>Contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible!</em> Careful screening for these disorders leads to early understanding and treatment.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What kind of screening and treatment can you expect?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nYou should expect a thorough assessment that includes a variety of tests and meeting with different members of the healthcare team.

Emotional abuse can destroy self-esteem through a pervasive, constant campaign of criticism, isolation, and intimidation. In <i>It&rsquo;s Not Like I Hit Her</i>, actors portray scenes based on real life stories, which show the various forms emotional abuse may take.

With the current understanding of the importance of glucose management for complication prevention in type 2 diabetes, insulin therapy is being considered as an early treatment option. Insulin therapy is no longer the treatment of last resort, but may be a proactive choice for many people (Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA), 2003a; Meltzer et al., 1998).</p>\r\n<p>There are three main forms of diabetes:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Type 1 diabetes affects approximately 10% of all people with diabetes and is primarily a result of an inability to produce insulin due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells. It is often diagnosed at a young age and requires insulin treatment. People with type 1 diabetes are susceptible to diabetic ketoacidosis if they do not take the required insulin.</li>\r\n    <li>Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 90% of those diagnosed with diabetes and results from a combination of insufficient insulin production and/or insulin resistance at the cell level.</li>\r\n    <li>Gestational diabetes (GDM) is diagnosed during pregnancy and affects 3.5 to 3.8% in the non-Aboriginal population (CDA, 2003a). Up to 40% of women who have had GDM will develop type 2 diabetes as they age (Health Canada, 2002).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Type 2 diabetes is considered to be a progressive condition. Many individuals develop secondary failure on oral antihyperglycemic agents, which means that eventually insulin is required. Approximately 50% of all clients with type 2 diabetes eventually require insulin therapy to maintain optimal glycemic control (DeWitt &amp; Hirsch, 2003; Grissinger &amp; Lease, 2003; Turner, Cull, Frighi, Holman, &amp; UKPDS Group, 1999).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","taxonomy":{"3":{"tid":"3","vid":"2","name":"Pre-reading","description":"All of the pre-reading content pages.","weight":"0"},"23":{"tid":"23","vid":"1","name":"Subcutaneous Administration of Insulin in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes","description":"Insulin BPG","weight":"0"}},"changed":"1262536653"},"timestamp":"1262536653"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=236"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Recommendations","body":"<ol>\r\n    <li>Nurses should assess psychosocial factors that may affect the individual&rsquo;s ability to successfully initiate insulin therapy.

You</h2>\r\n<p><strong>What is Diabetes?</strong> <br />\r\nIt is a disease that affects many people throughout their lives. If it is not treated, high blood sugar (glucose) levels can cause heart disease and kidney problems. It can also cause vision problems, nerve damage, amputations, and problems with sexual function.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em>There are 3 main types of diabetes: </em></font></strong><br />\r\n<strong>Type 1:</strong> 10% of people with diabetes have this type. The body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a substance that helps the body produce energy from the food we eat. Type 1 diabetes is often found at a young age. People with this type need insulin shots as part of the treatment. <br />\r\n<strong>Type 2:</strong> Affects about 90% of people with diabetes. This occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin. It can also happen when the body does not make proper use of the insulin it does make. <br />\r\n<strong>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM):</strong> This type of diabetes lasts for a short period of time during pregnancy and affects 3.5% of pregnant women. This may put mother and baby at higher risk for getting diabetes later in life.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em>What are the signs and symptoms of diabetes? </em></font></strong><br />\r\nThese may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Thirst</li>\r\n    <li>Weight change (gain or loss)&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Cuts and bruises that are slow to heal&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Tingling or numbness in hands or feet&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Getting or keeping an erection may be a problem</li>\r\n    <li>Frequent urination</li>\r\n    <li>Very tired (no energy)</li>\r\n    <li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n    <li>Frequent infections</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>People with type 2 diabetes may not show any or all of these signs. Finding  out you have diabetes early is important so that steps can be taken to  manage blood sugar levels and prevent or delay problems. It is important to  have regular check ups with your doctor or nurse to maintain your health.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em>How do you manage diabetes?</em></font></strong> <br />\r\nYou can expect to live an active and healthy life if your blood sugar is well  controlled. Learn more about diabetes by talking to your family doctor, nurse  or diet expert.</p>\r\n<p>Your healthcare team can help you to make healthy choices. These healthy choices may include: <br />\r\n<strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Keep a healthy weight and stay active. Watch what you eat and how much you eat. <br />\r\nFood plays a major role in how your body works to maintain blood sugar levels. You will need to make good food choices. Learn to reduce your stress level. <br />\r\n<strong>Medication:</strong> Treatment may involve the use of pills or a needle to assist your body in making or using  insulin better. You may expect your nurse or other health expert to discuss how to prepare and give needles in a safe way. They will teach you how to prevent and treat low blood sugar. You will learn the early signs of a low sugar level and what to do when you are sick.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em>Why is foot care important when managing your diabetes?</em></font></strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em> </em></font><br />\r\nFoot troubles are one problem that may occur if diabetes is not well managed. Protect your feet by following these simple steps: <br />\r\n<strong>Check your feet daily:</strong> Look for redness, blisters or open areas. If you cannot do this yourself, have someone else check for you. <br />\r\n<strong>Protect your feet &ndash; wear shoes:</strong> Wear shoes that fit well, support your feet and are not too tight. Do not wear shoes that cause redness or sore areas. See a footwear expert if you are at high risk for foot problems. <br />\r\n<strong>Keep your skin clean and soft:</strong> Wash your feet often. Check that the water is not too hot before putting your feet in. Do not soak them. Dry well between your toes. Use unscented creams. Do not put cream between your toes. <br />\r\n<strong>Don&rsquo;t hurt yourself with nail clippers or razors:</strong> Cut your nails straight across. Get help to cut your nails, if needed. Do not cut hard or callused areas. Go to a local foot care clinic.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em>How often should I have a check up?</em></font></strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em> </em></font><br />\r\nYou should have a yearly foot exam. This will help spot any foot problems that may increase your risk of having foot ulcers or sores. During the exam you can expect your nurse or doctor to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Ask you about any past problems with your feet&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Check your feet for numbness</li>\r\n    <li>Check for unusual foot shape&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Check for blood flow problems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em>What should you do if you have a diabetic foot ulcer? </em></font></strong><br />\r\nIf you are at high risk or have a foot ulcer, you may need a more detailed exam and special treatment. Find out more from experts in diabetes, footcare and other healthcare areas. The Canadian Diabetes Association, and Diabetes Centres are also a great resource. <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>","taxonomy":{"23":{"tid":"23","vid":"1","name":"Subcutaneous Administration of Insulin in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes","description":"Insulin BPG","weight":"0"},"7":{"tid":"7","vid":"2","name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content.","weight":"4"}},"changed":"1262538709"},"timestamp":"1262538709"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=245"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Background","body":"<p><b>Impact of stroke</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Regardless of treatment advances, stroke remains a devastating disease, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and one of the most expensive diseases to treat.</li>\r\n    <li>As the population ages, the economic burden of stroke is expected to increase.</li>\r\n    <li>Statistics analyzing health outcomes after stroke vary it has been estimated that 29% of individuals who experience a stroke die within a year, with 20% dying within three months; 25% becoming dependent; and 46% remaining independent (Hankey &amp; Warlow, 1999).</li>\r\n    <li>Stroke is one of the most costly medical conditions, accounting for a significant portion of overall Canadian healthcare dollars and costing the Canadian economy $2.7 billion annually (HSFO, 2002b).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b>Stroke in Canada</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in Canada, with approximately 7% of all deaths attributable to stroke (Wilson et al., 2001).</li>\r\n    <li>Although stroke is an increasingly treatable disease, the residual disability attributable to stroke remains significant.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b>Stroke in Ontario</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>It is estimated that 14,863 individuals were hospitalized for stroke in Ontario in 2000 (Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2002).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","taxonomy":{"3":{"tid":"3","vid":"2","name":"Pre-reading","description":"All of the pre-reading content pages.","weight":"0"},"24":{"tid":"24","vid":"1","name":"Stroke Assessment Across the Continuum of Care","description":"","weight":"0"}},"changed":"1260907736"},"timestamp":"1260907736"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=246"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Secondary Prevention","body":"<p><b>1.0&nbsp;</b>Nurses in all practice settings should screen clients for risk factors related to stroke in order to facilitate appropriate secondary prevention.

Katzmarzyk, 2003)</li>\r\n    <li>Obesity in childhood and adolescence may have adverse effects on social, academic, and economic outcomes in childhood and adulthood (Gortmaker, Must, Perrin, Sobol, &amp; Dietz, 1993; IOM, 2004; Must et al., 1992).&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Obese and overweight children and youth are at risk of developing serious social and emotional health consequences related to their weight status. Today&rsquo;s society often stigmatizes people with obesity. This stigmatization, in turn, can lead to shame, self-blame, and low self-esteem that may negatively affect academic and social functioning now and into adulthood (IOM, 2004, Lobstein et al., 2004).</li>\r\n    <li>The rising rates of obesity during childhood are influenced by various elements of what has been described as an <i>obesogenic* </i>environment (one that promotes sedentary or less active lifestyles and the overconsumption of food in general, and a greater consumption of high-fat high-calorie foods, in particular).</li>\r\n    <li>Numerous studies confirm that when parents are obese, the risk of persistent obesity in their children increases three-fold (Fuentes, Notkola, Shemeikka, Tuomilehto &amp; Nissinen, 2002; Mo-suwan, Tongkumchum &amp; Puetpaiboon, 2000; Whitaker, Wright, Pepe, Seidal &amp; Dietz, 1997).</li>\r\n    <li>From a prevention perspective, it is more important to note that lifestyle patterns relating to nutrition and physical activity develop within the context of the family.</li>\r\n    <li>Dietary energy and fat intake (Oliveria, Ellison, Moore, Gillman, Garrahie &amp; Singer, 1992) and physical activity profiles (Moore et al., 1991; Perusse, Tremblay &amp; Leblanc, 1988) in children closely reflect those of their parents.</li>\r\n    <li>Knowing the risk factors for the development of obesity in childhood and adolescence can help guide early identification and targeted prevention efforts.</li>\r\n    <li>The development of childhood overweight and obesity at individual, family, and population levels, suggest that effective prevention efforts will require the development of interventions that affect nutritional intake and physical activity at each of these

In addition, they may cause you pain, fear, anger, and depression.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">Signs and symptoms may include:</font> </em></strong><br />\r\nSwollen legs; change in skin colour to a brownish/red; burning or itching sensation; rash, redness or dry, crusty skin. An ulcer is often wet or weeping, and may have a yellow-white film covering it. Venous leg ulcers are usually located just above the ankle.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">Caring for your leg ulcer:</font></em></strong><em> </em><br />\r\nCaring for your leg ulcer includes good general health, a healthy diet, careful cleaning and dressing of the wound and use of special leg bandages, called compression bandages. The bandages must be applied by a trained nurse or physician. </p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nYou may need help from different healthcare providers as well as help at home. A physician or specially trained nurse will ensure proper assessment, which includes a physical examination, health history and a simple test called a Doppler ultrasound to measure the blood flow to your legs. </p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIf there is good blood flow to your legs, there are treatment options available to help heal your leg ulcer. Some of the treatment options are removal of the damaged tissue, appropriate dressings and wearing compression bandages or compression stockings. Compression works by helping the muscles to squeeze and push the blood back up through the veins and reduce swelling in the lower leg.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">What can you do to prevent venous leg ulcers?</font></em></strong><br />\r\nThere are lots of things that you can do to help prevent venous leg ulcers. Here are some suggestions:<br />\r\n<b>Exercise regularly:</b> Walking is the best exercise to assist the calf muscle to push the blood back towards the heart. If you are unable to walk, do ankle exercise when at rest. This can be done by moving the ankle and foot in a circular motion to the right and then to the left. If you are standing for prolonged periods of time, shift your weight from foot to foot, or stand up on tiptoes and then lower back down again. Do this a few times.<br />\r\n<b>Position:</b> You must raise your legs as much as possible at all times. If you are in bed or lying on a couch, raise your feet so that they are higher than the level of your heart. Support your legs and feet with pillows. Do not cross your legs.<br />\r\n<b>Diet:</b> Eat a healthy balanced diet and maintain an appropriate weight for your height. Being overweight will put an extra strain on your veins.<br />\r\n<b>Smoking:</b> Cut down or even better, stop smoking as it may interfere with healing. (See the RNAO health education fact sheet on smoking cessation available at www.rnao.org/bestpractices)<br />\r\n<b>Shoes:</b> Wear comfortable low-heeled shoes to accommodate stockings or bandages. <br />\r\n<b>Dressings:</b> Do not interfere with the dressings as you may damage or infect the leg ulcer. If you experience any discomfort from the dressings or bandages, contact your nurse or other healthcare professional.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">What should you do when the ulcer is healed?</font></em></strong><br />\r\nOnce the ulcer is healed: check your skin and moisturize daily; continue to wear support stockings or bandages as prescribed <em>(refer to the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions for use or ask your nurse to demonstrate their use)</em>; replace your stockings every 3 to 6 months to maintain a proper level of compression; take care not to injure your legs; do not sit close to fire &ndash; avoid extreme temperatures; continue an exercise program, healthy diet and leg elevation as before. If you see any damage to your skin, contact your nurse or doctor for advice.</p>","taxonomy":{"26":{"tid":"26","vid":"1","name":"Assessment and Management of Venous Leg Ulcer","description":"Leg Ulcer BPG","weight":"0"},"7":{"tid":"7","vid":"2","name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content.","weight":"4"}},"changed":"1260129135"},"timestamp":"1260129135"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=300"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Numeric Rating Scale","body":"<h4>Sample 2:<a name=\"nrs\"> </a>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp; <img width=\"424\" height=\"73\" src=\"file:///SDCard/RNAO/909bfac501a91abfa28d52fbe3e6210d\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"reference\">The patient rates pain on a scale from 0 to 10.</p>","taxonomy":{"1":{"tid":"1","vid":"1","name":"Assessment and Management of Pain","description":"This will include all pages that are in the Assessment and Management of Pain Guideline.","weight":"0"},"6":{"tid":"6","vid":"2","name":"Sample Tools","description":"All of the Sample Tools content.","weight":"3"}},"changed":"1259601645"},"timestamp":"1259601645"},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=301"},{"data":{"error":false,"data":{"title":"Glossary of Terms","body":"<ul><a name=\"top\"></a>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#term1\">Agnosia</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#term2\">Anhedonia</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#term3\">Aphasia</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#term4\">Apraxia</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#term5\">Caregiving Strategies</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#term6\">Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#term7\">DSM IV -

In order to latch the baby, the mother may support her breast with the hand opposite the side that the baby is nursing, with her thumb and fingers well back from the areola. Using the arm on the same side the baby is nursing on, the mother supports the baby&rsquo;s head and body and keeps the infant close. The baby should be at the level of the breast, and pillows are useful to provide additional support. The mother turns the baby towards her so that the infant&rsquo;s nose, chin, tummy and knees are touching her. The mother can tuck the infant&rsquo;s lower arm below her breast to keep it out of the way.</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"264\" height=\"272\" src=\"file:///SDCard/RNAO/7e415bf34f3f907d99ca8bb2d848f317\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Modified Cradle-Hold</font></h4>\r\n<p>The mother should be seated comfortably with additional pillows as necessary to support her back and arms then tuck the baby under breast. Use of a footstool may be beneficial. The mother can support her breast with fingers positioned at the base of her breast well back from the areola. The baby should be held in the arm opposite to the breast being used. The baby&rsquo;s shoulder and neck are supported by her hand and the baby is turned facing the mother. Holding the back of the infant&rsquo;s head with her hand may cause the infant to pull away when being put onto the breast. The baby&rsquo;s head and neck should be in a slightly extended position to facilitate the chin touching the breast (Biancuzzo, 1999; Lothian, 1995).</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"264\" height=\"270\" src=\"file:///SDCard/RNAO/7e8eae2922cf0b179e2405c58e7757f4\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Side-Lying</font></h4>\r\n<p>The mother should lie on her side with one or two pillows supporting her head and her lower arm flexed up. Use pillows as necessary to support her back and legs. The baby should be positioned side-lying, facing the mother, with the head low enough that the mom&rsquo;s nipple is at the level of the baby&rsquo;s nose, and the neck extended so that eye contact with the mother is possible <i>(Scarborough Breastfeeding Network, 1999; Society of Paediatric Nursing of the Royal College of Nursing, 1998)</i>. The mother&rsquo;s hand should be across baby&rsquo;s shoulder blades. The mother should pull the baby towards her abdomen, and wait. The baby will extend his head with a wide mouth and will latch onto the breast without assistance.</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"264\" height=\"216\" src=\"file:///SDCard/RNAO/fa53596a06138d3eb1bc345a25fc73d6\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Football Hold (Clutch Hold)</font></h4>\r\n<p>The mother should be seated comfortably as per the &lsquo;cradle-hold&rsquo; description.

Nurses from visible and non-visible minority groups, working across Canada in different health care environments, speak of their experiences of discrimination and racism and the challenges of working effectively in such environments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe challenge of diversity, which has been with us for generations, must clearly be addressed for the future such that it is no longer acceptable to engage in practices or tolerate attitudes that limit the potential of many fellow Canadians. This becomes especially important in health care where we face serious recruitment and retention challenges in nursing and other health care professions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCultural diversity in its broadest sense must be addressed in order to create a truly integrated health care workforce that embraces all types of diversity. Minorities, whether they be Canadians of colour, First Nations&rsquo; peoples, physically challenged, homosexual, etc., have made clear that there are ways and times they have felt unwelcome in nursing, in health care and in the workplace. They talk about treatment in the workplace that feels uncomfortable &ndash; either due to outward hostility or subtle discrimination.

If it is not treated, high blood sugar (glucose) levels can cause heart disease and kidney problems. It can also cause vision problems, nerve damage, amputations, and problems with sexual function.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">There are 3 main types of diabetes: </font></strong></em> <strong>Type 1:</strong> 10% of people with diabetes have this type. The body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a substance that helps the body produce energy from the food we eat. Type 1 diabetes is often found at a young age. People with this type need insulin shots as part of the treatment. <br />\r\n<strong>Type 2:</strong> Affects about 90% of people with diabetes. This occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin. It can also happen when the body does not make proper use of the insulin it does make. <br />\r\n<strong>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM):</strong> This type of diabetes lasts for a short period of time during pregnancy and affects 3.5% of pregnant women. This may put mother and baby at higher risk for getting diabetes later in life.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What are the signs and symptoms of diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nThese may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Thirst</li>\r\n    <li>Weight change (gain or loss)</li>\r\n    <li>Cuts and bruises that are slow to heal</li>\r\n    <li>Tingling or numbness in hands or feet</li>\r\n    <li>Getting or keeping an erection may be a problem</li>\r\n    <li>Frequent urination</li>\r\n    <li>Very tired (no energy)</li>\r\n    <li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n    <li>Frequent infections</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>People with type 2 diabetes may not show any or all of these signs. Finding out you have diabetes early is important so that steps can be taken to manage blood sugar levels and prevent or delay problems. It is important to have regular check ups with your doctor or nurse to maintain your health.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">How do you manage diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nYou can expect to live an active and healthy life if your blood sugar is well controlled. Learn more about diabetes by talking to your family doctor, nurse or diet expert. <br />\r\nYour healthcare team can help you to make healthy choices. These healthy choices may include: <br />\r\n<strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Keep a healthy weight and stay active. Watch what you eat and how much you eat. Food plays a major role in how your body works to maintain blood sugar levels. You will need to make good food choices. Learn to reduce your stress level. <br />\r\n<strong>Medication:</strong> Treatment may involve the use of pills or a needle to assist your body in making or using insulin better. You may expect your nurse or other health expert to discuss how to prepare and give needles in a safe way. They will teach you how to prevent and treat low blood sugar. You will learn the early signs of a low sugar level and what to do when you are sick.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">Why is foot care important when managing your diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nFoot troubles are one problem that may occur if diabetes is not well managed. Protect your feet by following these simple steps:<br />\r\n<strong> Check your feet daily:</strong> Look for redness, blisters or open areas. If you cannot do this yourself, have someone else check for you. <br />\r\n<strong>Protect your feet &ndash; wear shoes:</strong> Wear shoes that fit well, support your feet and are not too tight. Do not wear shoes that cause redness or sore areas. See a footwear expert if you are at high risk for foot problems. <br />\r\n<strong>Keep your skin clean and soft:</strong> Wash your feet often. Check that the water is not too hot before putting your feet in. Do not soak them. Dry well between your toes. Use unscented creams. Do not put cream between your toes. <br />\r\n<strong>Don&rsquo;t hurt yourself with nail clippers or razors:</strong> Cut your nails straight across. Get help to cut your nails, if needed. Do not cut hard or callused areas. Go to a local foot care clinic.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">How often should I have a check up?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nYou should have a yearly foot exam. This will help spot any foot problems that may increase your risk of having foot ulcers or sores. During the exam you can expect your nurse or doctor to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Ask you about any past problems with your feet</li>\r\n    <li>Check your feet for numbness</li>\r\n    <li>Check for unusual foot shape</li>\r\n    <li>Check for blood flow problems &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What should you do if you have a diabetic foot ulcer?</font></strong></em><br />\r\nIf you are at high risk or have a foot ulcer, you may need a more detailed exam and special treatment. <br />\r\nFind out more from experts in diabetes, footcare and other healthcare areas.

If it is not treated, high blood sugar (glucose) levels can cause heart disease and kidney problems. It can also cause vision problems, nerve damage, amputations, and problems with sexual function.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">There are 3 main types of diabetes:</font></strong></em><br />\r\n<strong>Type 1: </strong>10% of people with diabetes have this type. The body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a substance that helps the body produce energy from the food we eat. Type 1 diabetes is often found at a young age. People with this type need insulin shots as part of the treatment. <br />\r\n<strong>Type 2:</strong> Affects about 90% of people with diabetes. This occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin. It can also happen when the body does not make proper use of the insulin it does make. <br />\r\n<strong>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM): </strong>This type of diabetes lasts for a short period of time during pregnancy and affects 3.5% of pregnant women. This may put mother and baby at higher risk for getting diabetes later in life.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What are the signs and symptoms of diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nThese may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Thirst</li>\r\n    <li>Weight change (gain or loss)</li>\r\n    <li>Cuts and bruises that are slow to heal</li>\r\n    <li>Tingling or numbness in hands or feet</li>\r\n    <li>Getting or keeping an erection may be a problem</li>\r\n    <li>Frequent urination</li>\r\n    <li>Very tired (no energy)</li>\r\n    <li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n    <li>Frequent infections</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>People with type 2 diabetes may not show any or all of these signs. Finding out you have diabetes early is important so that steps can be taken to manage blood sugar levels and prevent or delay problems. It is important to have regular check ups with your doctor or nurse to maintain your health.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">How do you manage diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nYou can expect to live an active and healthy life if your blood sugar is well controlled. Learn more about diabetes by talking to your family doctor, nurse or diet expert. <br />\r\nYour healthcare team can help you to make healthy choices. These healthy choices may include: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Keep a healthy weight and stay active. Watch what you eat and how much you eat. <br />\r\nFood plays a major role in how your body works to maintain blood sugar levels. You will need to make <br />\r\ngood food choices. Learn to reduce your stress level. <br />\r\n<strong>Medication:</strong> Treatment may involve the use of pills or a needle to assist your body in making or using insulin better. You may expect your nurse or other health expert to discuss how to prepare and give needles in a safe way. They will teach you how to prevent and treat low blood sugar. You will learn the early signs of a low sugar level and what to do when you are sick.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">Why is foot care important when managing your diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nFoot troubles are one problem that may occur if diabetes is not well managed. Protect your feet by following these simple steps: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Check your feet daily:</strong> Look for redness, blisters or open areas. If you cannot do this yourself, have someone else check for you. <br />\r\n<strong>Protect your feet &ndash; wear shoes:</strong> Wear shoes that fit well, support your feet and are not too tight. Do not wear shoes that cause redness or sore areas. See a footwear expert if you are at high risk for foot problems. <br />\r\n<strong>Keep your skin clean and soft:</strong> Wash your feet often. Check that the water is not too hot before putting your feet in. Do not soak them. Dry well between your toes. Use unscented creams. Do not put cream between your toes. <br />\r\n<strong>Don&rsquo;t hurt yourself with nail clippers or razors:</strong> Cut your nails straight across. Get help to cut your nails, if needed. Do not cut hard or callused areas. Go to a local foot care clinic.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">How often should I have a check up?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nYou should have a yearly foot exam. This will help spot any foot problems that may increase your risk of having foot ulcers or sores. During the exam you can expect your nurse or doctor to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Ask you about any past problems with your feet</li>\r\n    <li>Check your feet for numbness</li>\r\n    <li>Check for unusual foot shape</li>\r\n    <li>Check for blood flow problems&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What should you do if you have a diabetic foot ulcer?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nIf you are at high risk or have a foot ulcer, you may need a more detailed exam and special treatment. Find out more from experts in diabetes, footcare and other healthcare areas.

Polices regarding storage of clients&rsquo; belongings and access to nonpatient areas (e.g. staff room, equipment room) may help to address these factors and should be developed with involvement of all staff members (e.g. allied health professionals, housekeeping, patient care aides, security, etc.)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hanging Risks:</strong></p>\r\n<p><img width=\"225\" height=\"225\" alt=\"\" src=\"file:///SDCard/RNAO/2c426225b4a0b55605c8f79f3eb0a9de\" /><br />\r\nA knotted sheet can serve as a hanging risk when combined with solid core hospital doors on inpatient psychiatric units. <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"225\" height=\"225\" alt=\"\" src=\"file:///SDCard/RNAO/373f17218cd1c52645d2c08fae4713b1\" /><br />\r\nThe combination of a sheet and solid core door will support the entire body weight off the ground. <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"225\" height=\"225\" alt=\"\" src=\"file:///SDCard/RNAO/5963b0441b27ce25b0b01741018f6839\" /><br />\r\nPlumbing fixtures pose risk but can be enclosed to minimize risk. <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"225\" height=\"225\" alt=\"\" src=\"file:///SDCard/RNAO/80ea7d149da55ab241e33789f95afeb2\" /><br />\r\nGrab bars standard for ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) pose a hanging risk from a sitting position.

In order to reduce the potential of excessive pressure, it is generally recommended that a 10 mL (or larger) syringe be used for flushing (RCN 2003). Larger syringes create <strong>less pressure when flushing and more pressure when withdrawing or aspirating.</strong> Smaller syringes on the other hand produce <strong>more pressure when flushing and less pressure when withdrawing.</strong></p>\r\n            <p>When using the turbulent flush technique, it is important to assess device function as high pressures could be generated in devices that have occlusion complications (e.g., fibrin buildup) or are constricted in any way (e.g., kinked or clamped). <em>Appendix F</em> contains information for assessment of blood withdrawal and management of withdrawal occlusion.</p>\r\n            <p><strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> Remember to heparinize the device not the client. Some clients that require a significant volume or concentration of Heparin locking solutions may experience complications. Consider withdrawal of the heparin lock prior to flushing to reduce the amount of heparin a client receives. While this is practiced in some settings, there is no scientific evidence to support this recommendation.

If a withdrawal occlusion persists, it is expected that the individual nurse will perform only those aspects of the assessment and resolution of the withdrawal occlusion for which they have experience. It is expected that nurses seek appropriate consultation in instances where the client&rsquo;s care needs surpass their ability to act independently. Nurses are expected to report the withdrawal occlusion to physician, advocate for appropriate medical interventions to determine the cause of the occlusion and for resolution of the occlusion before using the device for medication or fluid administration. Solutions such as irritants, vesicants with a pH less than 5.0 or greater than 9.0 or osmolarity greater than 500 should not be administered through a device where blood return is not obtained because if the device is malpositioned it can result in complications (e.g., infiltration and extravasation).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Critical Thinking</strong><br />\r\nIn some situations (e.g., palliation, access is severely limited, unblocking interventions limited or client choice), it may be necessary to analyze the risk and benefits of using a device with a withdrawal occlusion. Involvement of the other members of the health care team as well as the client in the decision is important to ensure appropriate decision-making. The client/caregivers should be assisted to make an informed consent by understanding the risk and benefits of receiving their specific infusion through a device with a withdrawal occlusion. Solutions that are non-irritating, non-vesicant and with a pH greater than 5.0 and less than 9.0, and osmolality &lt;500, will generally result in less severe complications if infiltration occurs.

A hostile  stance increases tension and interferes with verbal communication. When  approaching an angry person:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"square\">\r\n    <li>Stand about one metre (three       feet) away (that is, outside the individual&rsquo;s personal space), on an angle       (as opposed to . directly in front of the person) and on the person&rsquo;s       non-dominant side (people usually wear watches and part hair on the       non-dominant side)</li>\r\n    <li>Place yourself so that you have a       clear exit</li>\r\n    <li>Position yourself on the same       physical level; avoid standing over the person</li>\r\n    <li>Use calm body language: hands       open, attentive facial expression, relaxed posture</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid pointing or gesturing; make       no sudden movements</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid touching the person</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid staring eye contact</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Verbal  Communication</strong></p>\r\n<p>Talking can defuse  anger. Here are some strategies to use when speaking with someone who is angry:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"square\">\r\n    <li>Make your first contact neutral       or non-directive: for example, ask how you can help. This inquiry       communicates a sense of normal interaction.</li>\r\n    <li>Always be courteous to clients       despite their behaviour. Introduce yourself and call them by name.</li>\r\n    <li>Use active listening skills. Do       not interrupt.</li>\r\n    <li>Confirm your understanding of the       issue or problem by repeating what the client has told you.</li>\r\n    <li>Acknowledge the client&rsquo;s feelings       and concerns.</li>\r\n    <li>Use simple language; avoid jargon       or technical language.</li>\r\n    <li>Speak slowly, quietly and       confidently.</li>\r\n    <li>Remain open-minded and objective.</li>\r\n    <li>Always be honest. Do not make       promises that you cannot keep.</li>\r\n    <li>Keep the client&rsquo;s attention       focused on the current issue.</li>\r\n    <li>Use silence as a calming tool.</li>\r\n    <li>Always attempt to explain delays       or long waiting periods. Not doing so can be construed as discourtesy.</li>\r\n    <li>Be prepared to apologize as       necessary and accept criticism positively.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid giving commands.</li>\r\n    <li>Look for ways to the help the       person save face.</li>\r\n    <li>In a calm and non-threatening       way, explain that violence is unacceptable and is not tolerated.</li>\r\n    <li>If you feel threatened, politely       and calmly terminate the interaction.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Terminating  an Interaction with an Angry Client</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you feel  threatened, or if the interaction is increasing a client&rsquo;s anger, terminate the  interaction immediately.</p>\r\n<ul type=\"square\">\r\n    <li>Calmly but politely interrupt the       conversation.</li>\r\n    <li>Tell the person that the       conversation is over.</li>\r\n    <li>Either leave or ask the person to       leave.</li>\r\n    <li>If the person does not leave,       inform a manager or supervisor immediately.</li>\r\n    <li>Notify other staff in the       immediate area.</li>\r\n    <li>If required, call the emergency       response team. Consider using a silent alarm or code word if your       organization uses these.</li>\r\n    <li>Call the police.</li>\r\n    <li>If you threaten to call the       police, be prepared to call

Learning how to take care of your ostomy will help you to gain independence and live your life with comfort and confidence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">What is an Ostomy?</font></em></strong><br />\r\nAn ostomy is a surgical opening created from your intestine or urinary tract to the surface of your abdomen. This opening is called a stoma and it is created to remove feces or urine from your body. An ostomy appliance is placed over the stoma to collect the feces or urine. The <strong>odour proof ostomy pouch</strong> needs to be emptied and cleaned throughout the day. This type of operation can be done for newborns, children and adults.<br />\r\n<img width=\"185\" height=\"193\" src=\"file:///SDCard/RNAO/e47f135fb45ae3925b9b6c41cbfa5346\" alt=\"\" /><br />\r\nThis is an example of what an ostomy looks like on the outside of your abdomen after surgery. The red-coloured opening is the stoma, which empties waste from your body.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">If You Need to Have an Ostomy or Have One Already...</font></em></strong><br />\r\nSpeak to your <strong>Enterostomal Therapy Nurse (ET Nurse)</strong> or nurse. The nurse will teach and help prepare you and your family for the ostomy, answer your questions and listen to your concerns. If you are caring for a loved one with an ostomy, the nurse will teach you how to care for the ostomy.<br />\r\nYour nurse will give you information about <strong>taking care of your ostomy</strong> so you will become independent. This includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Caring for your ostomy appliance;</li>\r\n    <li>Caring for your skin to prevent problems;</li>\r\n    <li>Preventing leakage to control odour from your ostomy appliance;</li>\r\n    <li>Eating foods that are healthy for you and your ostomy; and</li>\r\n    <li>Where to get follow-up care, counseling and emergency contact information.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">Will Having an Ostomy Affect My Lifestyle?</font></em></strong><br />\r\nHaving an ostomy is a life changing experience. If you have an ostomy, you should still be able to work, play sports, exercise and lead an active life. Your nurse can guide you on how to maintain your lifestyle. If you are not able to go back to your usual routine, speak to your nurse to find out what you can do.<br />\r\nAttend ostomy learning sessions and ask your family to be involved. This can help them to better understand your condition and learn how they can help you.<br />\r\nFor parents, if your child has an ostomy, you should inform the child's teacher or care provider. If your child has a problem or accident with the ostomy appliance at school, then the teacher will have an understanding of your child's condition and know how to help.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">How Do I Care For My Ostomy?</font></strong></em><br />\r\nYour ET Nurse or nurse will teach you and/or your family how to care for your ostomy at home. Here are some tips when caring for your ostomy:<br />\r\n<strong>Skin care around your stoma</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Use warm water and a soft tissue or cloth to clean around the stoma.</li>\r\n    <li>Do not use creams or oils. These will prevent your ostomy appliance from sealing around your stoma.</li>\r\n    <li>If the skin around the stoma has a lot of hair, clip the area using scissors. This will help the ostomy</li>\r\n    <li>appliance to stick to your skin better.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Cleaning your ostomy pouch</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Ostomy pouches can be washed with warm soapy water and reused. Let the ostomy pouch dry</li>\r\n    <li>completely before reusing.</li>\r\n    <li>You should always have more than one ostomy pouch on-hand.</li>\r\n    <li>Always empty the ostomy pouch into the toilet when it is 1/3 full.</li>\r\n    <li>Empty the ostomy pouch first before throwing it away into the garbage. Ostomy pouches should never</li>\r\n    <li>be flushed down the toilet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Bathing</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Bathing does not hurt the stoma.</li>\r\n    <li>Showers are recommended over baths since there is less soaking of the ostomy pouch when showering.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid using bath oils, and salts in the water. These will prevent your ostomy appliance from sticking to</li>\r\n    <li>your skin.</li>\r\n    <li>You can bathe with the ostomy appliance on or off.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Diet</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Regaining a normal diet will take time. Some changes may be necessary.</li>\r\n    <li>Your nurse will refer you to a Registered Dietician who can answer questions and concerns you</li>\r\n    <li>may have about your diet.</li>\r\n    <li>Always chew your food as much as possible to help your body break down the food.</li>\r\n    <li>Drink 8-10 cups of fluid every day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What Do I Do If My Ostomy Appliance is Leaking?</font></strong></em><br />\r\nAlways be prepared should your ostomy appliance begin to leak. You should keep extra supplies on hand in places you regularly visit, such as at your work or in your car. You can also carry a small ostomy travel bag with you so that you can change your ostomy appliance anywhere, as needed. Ask your nurse where you can get an ostomy travel bag.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">Join Your Local Ostomy Support Group!</font></strong></em><br />\r\nYour local United Ostomy Association (UOA) ostomy support group provides self-help and support for people and families of those with an ostomy.

Education Fact Sheet","body":"<h4>Decision Support for Patient living with Chronic Kidney Disease</h4>\r\n<p>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) happens when the kidneys are damaged and do not heal. This affects how the kidneys remove wastes and water. Some causes of CKD are diabetes, vascular (blood vessel) disease and inflammation of the kidneys. In addition to affecting your kidneys, CKD can also affect other parts of your body, such as your lungs and heart. CKD has five stages but, with treatment and life-style changes, it may be possible to slow down or stop CKD from progressing from one stage to the next.</p>\r\n<p>Having CKD can be a life changing experience. You and your family may feel uncertain about how to keep an eye on your health, manage your symptoms or choose the best treatment for you. It is important for you to share your thoughts and ideas with your health care team. They need to understand your preferences, personal situation and what is most important to you. Then you can work with your team to set priorities and determine the type of care that best fits with your and your family&rsquo;s choices.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><font color=\"#006666\">You will face many health and lifestyle decisions when you live with CKD. Most people, who are living with CKD, need to make decisions about</font>:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Diet, weight and exercise;</li>\r\n    <li>Medication;</li>\r\n    <li>Lifestyle changes; and</li>\r\n    <li>Planning for future care.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><font color=\"#006666\">If your CKD progresses through all the stages of kidney disease, you may also face treatment decisions about wheather or not to have:</font></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>A Kidney Transplant:</strong> a working kidney from another person is put into your body during an operation.</li>\r\n    <li>This kidney will remove wastes and water.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Peritoneal Dialysis:</strong> a catheter is placed in your abdomen during an operation. You use this catheter to put a special fluid into your abdomen to remove wastes and water. You do this treatment at home every night or four times per day.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Hemodialysis:</strong> access to your blood is created during an operation using your own blood vessels (a fistula),</li>\r\n    <li>an artificial blood vessel (graft) or a catheter. The fistula or catheter are attached to a machine that filters wastes and water out of your blood. You do this treatment three to six times a week at a hemodialysis centre with the help of a nurse or you can learn how to do this at home.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>A Trial of Dialysis:</strong> you agree to peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis for a set number of treatments and then decide about doing dialysis as a long-term treatment.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Conservative/Palliative Treatment:</strong> you decide not to have life supporting peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. You choose to receive medications and other treatments for physical and emotional symptoms.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For some decisions, it is quite easy for you and your healthcare team to reach a decision. For example, it is usually quite straight forward to make a decision about taking medication to control high blood pressure,vbecause scientific evidence clearly shows benefits far outweigh side effects or long term complications. However, for many CKD care decisions, there is no clear &lsquo;right&rsquo; or &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; choice. In these cases you may feelbuncertain about which option to choose or what next steps to take. You can help reduce your uncertainty by:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>getting information about your options,</li>\r\n    <li>getting information about the potential good and bad aspects linked to each option,</li>\r\n    <li>being clear about which of the good or bad aspects are most important to you, and</li>\r\n    <li>getting enough support from your family and friends to work through your decision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It is important for you to know and understand the best choices for YOU! Do not hesitate to let your healthcare team know if you are experiencing difficulty in making a decision. The goal is to make sure that, for any decisions you are facing, you receive information that is:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><em><strong>balanced</strong></em> - both the good and bad aspects of the options are explained,</li>\r\n    <li><em><strong>neutral</strong></em> &ndash; not influenced by the personal opinions of healthcare members,</li>\r\n    <li><em><strong>free of pressure</strong></em> &ndash; you decide on the option that best meets your needs, values and preferences.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your healthcare team will help you be involved in making decisions about your care and treatment by ensuring you:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>receive information that is clear to you,</li>\r\n    <li><em><strong>understand both the good and bad aspects of the options you are considering</strong></em></li>\r\n    <li>feel that your decisions are <em><strong>consistent with your values and preferences</strong></em></li>\r\n    <li>feel that you have enough support and advice to make an informed decision</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are many other resources available to you, such as: The Kidney Foundation of Canada (KFoC):<br />\r\nwww.kidney.ca.
