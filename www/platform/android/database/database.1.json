This affects how the kidneys remove wastes and water. Some causes of CKD are diabetes, vascular (blood vessel) disease and inflammation of the kidneys. In addition to affecting your kidneys, CKD can also affect other parts of your body, such as your lungs and heart. CKD has five stages but, with treatment and life-style changes, it may be possible to slow down or stop CKD from progressing from one stage to the next.</p>\r\n<p>Having CKD can be a life changing experience. You and your family may feel uncertain about how to keep an eye on your health, manage your symptoms or choose the best treatment for you. It is important for you to share your thoughts and ideas with your health care team. They need to understand your preferences, personal situation and what is most important to you. Then you can work with your team to set priorities and determine the type of care that best fits with your and your family&rsquo;s choices.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><font color=\"#006666\">You will face many health and lifestyle decisions when you live with CKD. Most people, who are living with CKD, need to make decisions about</font>:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Diet, weight and exercise;</li>\r\n    <li>Medication;</li>\r\n    <li>Lifestyle changes; and</li>\r\n    <li>Planning for future care.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><font color=\"#006666\">If your CKD progresses through all the stages of kidney disease, you may also face treatment decisions about wheather or not to have:</font></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>A Kidney Transplant:</strong> a working kidney from another person is put into your body during an operation.</li>\r\n    <li>This kidney will remove wastes and water.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Peritoneal Dialysis:</strong> a catheter is placed in your abdomen during an operation. You use this catheter to put a special fluid into your abdomen to remove wastes and water. You do this treatment at home every night or four times per day.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Hemodialysis:</strong> access to your blood is created during an operation using your own blood vessels (a fistula),</li>\r\n    <li>an artificial blood vessel (graft) or a catheter. The fistula or catheter are attached to a machine that filters wastes and water out of your blood. You do this treatment three to six times a week at a hemodialysis centre with the help of a nurse or you can learn how to do this at home.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>A Trial of Dialysis:</strong> you agree to peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis for a set number of treatments and then decide about doing dialysis as a long-term treatment.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Conservative/Palliative Treatment:</strong> you decide not to have life supporting peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. You choose to receive medications and other treatments for physical and emotional symptoms.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For some decisions, it is quite easy for you and your healthcare team to reach a decision. For example, it is usually quite straight forward to make a decision about taking medication to control high blood pressure,vbecause scientific evidence clearly shows benefits far outweigh side effects or long term complications. However, for many CKD care decisions, there is no clear &lsquo;right&rsquo; or &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; choice. In these cases you may feelbuncertain about which option to choose or what next steps to take. You can help reduce your uncertainty by:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>getting information about your options,</li>\r\n    <li>getting information about the potential good and bad aspects linked to each option,</li>\r\n    <li>being clear about which of the good or bad aspects are most important to you, and</li>\r\n    <li>getting enough support from your family and friends to work through your decision.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It is important for you to know and understand the best choices for YOU! Do not hesitate to let your healthcare team know if you are experiencing difficulty in making a decision. The goal is to make sure that, for any decisions you are facing, you receive information that is:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><em><strong>balanced</strong></em> - both the good and bad aspects of the options are explained,</li>\r\n    <li><em><strong>neutral</strong></em> &ndash; not influenced by the personal opinions of healthcare members,</li>\r\n    <li><em><strong>free of pressure</strong></em> &ndash; you decide on the option that best meets your needs, values and preferences.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your healthcare team will help you be involved in making decisions about your care and treatment by ensuring you:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>receive information that is clear to you,</li>\r\n    <li><em><strong>understand both the good and bad aspects of the options you are considering</strong></em></li>\r\n    <li>feel that your decisions are <em><strong>consistent with your values and preferences</strong></em></li>\r\n    <li>feel that you have enough support and advice to make an informed decision</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are many other resources available to you, such as: The Kidney Foundation of Canada (KFoC):<br />\r\nwww.kidney.ca.

Learning how to take care of your ostomy will help you to gain independence and live your life with comfort and confidence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">What is an Ostomy?</font></em></strong><br />\r\nAn ostomy is a surgical opening created from your intestine or urinary tract to the surface of your abdomen. This opening is called a stoma and it is created to remove feces or urine from your body. An ostomy appliance is placed over the stoma to collect the feces or urine. The <strong>odour proof ostomy pouch</strong> needs to be emptied and cleaned throughout the day. This type of operation can be done for newborns, children and adults.<br />\r\n<img width=\"185\" height=\"193\" src=\"database/images/ostomy.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\r\nThis is an example of what an ostomy looks like on the outside of your abdomen after surgery. The red-coloured opening is the stoma, which empties waste from your body.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">If You Need to Have an Ostomy or Have One Already...</font></em></strong><br />\r\nSpeak to your <strong>Enterostomal Therapy Nurse (ET Nurse)</strong> or nurse. The nurse will teach and help prepare you and your family for the ostomy, answer your questions and listen to your concerns. If you are caring for a loved one with an ostomy, the nurse will teach you how to care for the ostomy.<br />\r\nYour nurse will give you information about <strong>taking care of your ostomy</strong> so you will become independent. This includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Caring for your ostomy appliance;</li>\r\n    <li>Caring for your skin to prevent problems;</li>\r\n    <li>Preventing leakage to control odour from your ostomy appliance;</li>\r\n    <li>Eating foods that are healthy for you and your ostomy; and</li>\r\n    <li>Where to get follow-up care, counseling and emergency contact information.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">Will Having an Ostomy Affect My Lifestyle?</font></em></strong><br />\r\nHaving an ostomy is a life changing experience. If you have an ostomy, you should still be able to work, play sports, exercise and lead an active life. Your nurse can guide you on how to maintain your lifestyle. If you are not able to go back to your usual routine, speak to your nurse to find out what you can do.<br />\r\nAttend ostomy learning sessions and ask your family to be involved. This can help them to better understand your condition and learn how they can help you.<br />\r\nFor parents, if your child has an ostomy, you should inform the child's teacher or care provider. If your child has a problem or accident with the ostomy appliance at school, then the teacher will have an understanding of your child's condition and know how to help.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">How Do I Care For My Ostomy?</font></strong></em><br />\r\nYour ET Nurse or nurse will teach you and/or your family how to care for your ostomy at home. Here are some tips when caring for your ostomy:<br />\r\n<strong>Skin care around your stoma</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Use warm water and a soft tissue or cloth to clean around the stoma.</li>\r\n    <li>Do not use creams or oils. These will prevent your ostomy appliance from sealing around your stoma.</li>\r\n    <li>If the skin around the stoma has a lot of hair, clip the area using scissors. This will help the ostomy</li>\r\n    <li>appliance to stick to your skin better.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Cleaning your ostomy pouch</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Ostomy pouches can be washed with warm soapy water and reused. Let the ostomy pouch dry</li>\r\n    <li>completely before reusing.</li>\r\n    <li>You should always have more than one ostomy pouch on-hand.</li>\r\n    <li>Always empty the ostomy pouch into the toilet when it is 1/3 full.</li>\r\n    <li>Empty the ostomy pouch first before throwing it away into the garbage. Ostomy pouches should never</li>\r\n    <li>be flushed down the toilet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Bathing</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Bathing does not hurt the stoma.</li>\r\n    <li>Showers are recommended over baths since there is less soaking of the ostomy pouch when showering.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid using bath oils, and salts in the water. These will prevent your ostomy appliance from sticking to</li>\r\n    <li>your skin.</li>\r\n    <li>You can bathe with the ostomy appliance on or off.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Diet</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Regaining a normal diet will take time. Some changes may be necessary.</li>\r\n    <li>Your nurse will refer you to a Registered Dietician who can answer questions and concerns you</li>\r\n    <li>may have about your diet.</li>\r\n    <li>Always chew your food as much as possible to help your body break down the food.</li>\r\n    <li>Drink 8-10 cups of fluid every day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What Do I Do If My Ostomy Appliance is Leaking?</font></strong></em><br />\r\nAlways be prepared should your ostomy appliance begin to leak. You should keep extra supplies on hand in places you regularly visit, such as at your work or in your car. You can also carry a small ostomy travel bag with you so that you can change your ostomy appliance anywhere, as needed. Ask your nurse where you can get an ostomy travel bag.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">Join Your Local Ostomy Support Group!</font></strong></em><br />\r\nYour local United Ostomy Association (UOA) ostomy support group provides self-help and support for people and families of those with an ostomy. By sharing experiences, information and coping strategies you and your family will learn that you are not alone. Ask your family to attend these meetings with you. Your nurse can let you know how you can join your local ostomy support chapter.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><em>Reference:</em></strong><em><br />\r\nRegistered Nurses' Association of Ontario (2009).

When  approaching an angry person:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"square\">\r\n    <li>Stand about one metre (three       feet) away (that is, outside the individual&rsquo;s personal space), on an angle       (as opposed to . directly in front of the person) and on the person&rsquo;s       non-dominant side (people usually wear watches and part hair on the       non-dominant side)</li>\r\n    <li>Place yourself so that you have a       clear exit</li>\r\n    <li>Position yourself on the same       physical level; avoid standing over the person</li>\r\n    <li>Use calm body language: hands       open, attentive facial expression, relaxed posture</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid pointing or gesturing; make       no sudden movements</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid touching the person</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid staring eye contact</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Verbal  Communication</strong></p>\r\n<p>Talking can defuse  anger. Here are some strategies to use when speaking with someone who is angry:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"square\">\r\n    <li>Make your first contact neutral       or non-directive: for example, ask how you can help. This inquiry       communicates a sense of normal interaction.</li>\r\n    <li>Always be courteous to clients       despite their behaviour. Introduce yourself and call them by name.</li>\r\n    <li>Use active listening skills. Do       not interrupt.</li>\r\n    <li>Confirm your understanding of the       issue or problem by repeating what the client has told you.</li>\r\n    <li>Acknowledge the client&rsquo;s feelings       and concerns.</li>\r\n    <li>Use simple language; avoid jargon       or technical language.</li>\r\n    <li>Speak slowly, quietly and       confidently.</li>\r\n    <li>Remain open-minded and objective.</li>\r\n    <li>Always be honest. Do not make       promises that you cannot keep.</li>\r\n    <li>Keep the client&rsquo;s attention       focused on the current issue.</li>\r\n    <li>Use silence as a calming tool.</li>\r\n    <li>Always attempt to explain delays       or long waiting periods. Not doing so can be construed as discourtesy.</li>\r\n    <li>Be prepared to apologize as       necessary and accept criticism positively.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid giving commands.</li>\r\n    <li>Look for ways to the help the       person save face.</li>\r\n    <li>In a calm and non-threatening       way, explain that violence is unacceptable and is not tolerated.</li>\r\n    <li>If you feel threatened, politely       and calmly terminate the interaction.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Terminating  an Interaction with an Angry Client</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you feel  threatened, or if the interaction is increasing a client&rsquo;s anger, terminate the  interaction immediately.</p>\r\n<ul type=\"square\">\r\n    <li>Calmly but politely interrupt the       conversation.</li>\r\n    <li>Tell the person that the       conversation is over.</li>\r\n    <li>Either leave or ask the person to       leave.</li>\r\n    <li>If the person does not leave,       inform a manager or supervisor immediately.</li>\r\n    <li>Notify other staff in the       immediate area.</li>\r\n    <li>If required, call the emergency       response team.

If a withdrawal occlusion persists, it is expected that the individual nurse will perform only those aspects of the assessment and resolution of the withdrawal occlusion for which they have experience. It is expected that nurses seek appropriate consultation in instances where the client&rsquo;s care needs surpass their ability to act independently. Nurses are expected to report the withdrawal occlusion to physician, advocate for appropriate medical interventions to determine the cause of the occlusion and for resolution of the occlusion before using the device for medication or fluid administration. Solutions such as irritants, vesicants with a pH less than 5.0 or greater than 9.0 or osmolarity greater than 500 should not be administered through a device where blood return is not obtained because if the device is malpositioned it can result in complications (e.g., infiltration and extravasation).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Critical Thinking</strong><br />\r\nIn some situations (e.g., palliation, access is severely limited, unblocking interventions limited or client choice), it may be necessary to analyze the risk and benefits of using a device with a withdrawal occlusion. Involvement of the other members of the health care team as well as the client in the decision is important to ensure appropriate decision-making. The client/caregivers should be assisted to make an informed consent by understanding the risk and benefits of receiving their specific infusion through a device with a withdrawal occlusion. Solutions that are non-irritating, non-vesicant and with a pH greater than 5.0 and less than 9.0, and osmolality &lt;500, will generally result in less severe complications if infiltration occurs.

In order to reduce the potential of excessive pressure, it is generally recommended that a 10 mL (or larger) syringe be used for flushing (RCN 2003). Larger syringes create <strong>less pressure when flushing and more pressure when withdrawing or aspirating.</strong> Smaller syringes on the other hand produce <strong>more pressure when flushing and less pressure when withdrawing.</strong></p>\r\n            <p>When using the turbulent flush technique, it is important to assess device function as high pressures could be generated in devices that have occlusion complications (e.g., fibrin buildup) or are constricted in any way (e.g., kinked or clamped). <em>Appendix F</em> contains information for assessment of blood withdrawal and management of withdrawal occlusion.</p>\r\n            <p><strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> Remember to heparinize the device not the client. Some clients that require a significant volume or concentration of Heparin locking solutions may experience complications. Consider withdrawal of the heparin lock prior to flushing to reduce the amount of heparin a client receives.

In addition, oral pain can have an economic impact on society through time away from work, lost productivity and increased health care expenditures (Watt, 2005).</li>\r\n    <li>The greatest burden of oral disease is to disadvantaged and poor population groups, both in developing, and developed countries (Petersen et al., 2005).</li>\r\n    <li><em><strong>Residence of long term care:</strong></em> &ldquo;Aspiration of oropharyngeal (including periodontal) pathogens is the dominant cause of nursing home acquired pneumonia; factors reflecting poor oral health strongly correlate with increased risk of developing aspiration pneumonia&rdquo; (Shay, 2002, p.1215).

If it is not treated, high blood sugar (glucose) levels can cause heart disease and kidney problems. It can also cause vision problems, nerve damage, amputations, and problems with sexual function.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">There are 3 main types of diabetes:</font></strong></em><br />\r\n<strong>Type 1: </strong>10% of people with diabetes have this type. The body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a substance that helps the body produce energy from the food we eat. Type 1 diabetes is often found at a young age. People with this type need insulin shots as part of the treatment. <br />\r\n<strong>Type 2:</strong> Affects about 90% of people with diabetes. This occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin. It can also happen when the body does not make proper use of the insulin it does make. <br />\r\n<strong>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM): </strong>This type of diabetes lasts for a short period of time during pregnancy and affects 3.5% of pregnant women. This may put mother and baby at higher risk for getting diabetes later in life.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What are the signs and symptoms of diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nThese may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Thirst</li>\r\n    <li>Weight change (gain or loss)</li>\r\n    <li>Cuts and bruises that are slow to heal</li>\r\n    <li>Tingling or numbness in hands or feet</li>\r\n    <li>Getting or keeping an erection may be a problem</li>\r\n    <li>Frequent urination</li>\r\n    <li>Very tired (no energy)</li>\r\n    <li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n    <li>Frequent infections</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>People with type 2 diabetes may not show any or all of these signs. Finding out you have diabetes early is important so that steps can be taken to manage blood sugar levels and prevent or delay problems. It is important to have regular check ups with your doctor or nurse to maintain your health.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">How do you manage diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nYou can expect to live an active and healthy life if your blood sugar is well controlled. Learn more about diabetes by talking to your family doctor, nurse or diet expert. <br />\r\nYour healthcare team can help you to make healthy choices. These healthy choices may include: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Keep a healthy weight and stay active. Watch what you eat and how much you eat. <br />\r\nFood plays a major role in how your body works to maintain blood sugar levels. You will need to make <br />\r\ngood food choices. Learn to reduce your stress level. <br />\r\n<strong>Medication:</strong> Treatment may involve the use of pills or a needle to assist your body in making or using insulin better. You may expect your nurse or other health expert to discuss how to prepare and give needles in a safe way. They will teach you how to prevent and treat low blood sugar. You will learn the early signs of a low sugar level and what to do when you are sick.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">Why is foot care important when managing your diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nFoot troubles are one problem that may occur if diabetes is not well managed. Protect your feet by following these simple steps: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Check your feet daily:</strong> Look for redness, blisters or open areas. If you cannot do this yourself, have someone else check for you. <br />\r\n<strong>Protect your feet &ndash; wear shoes:</strong> Wear shoes that fit well, support your feet and are not too tight. Do not wear shoes that cause redness or sore areas. See a footwear expert if you are at high risk for foot problems. <br />\r\n<strong>Keep your skin clean and soft:</strong> Wash your feet often. Check that the water is not too hot before putting your feet in. Do not soak them. Dry well between your toes. Use unscented creams. Do not put cream between your toes. <br />\r\n<strong>Don&rsquo;t hurt yourself with nail clippers or razors:</strong> Cut your nails straight across. Get help to cut your nails, if needed. Do not cut hard or callused areas. Go to a local foot care clinic.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">How often should I have a check up?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nYou should have a yearly foot exam. This will help spot any foot problems that may increase your risk of having foot ulcers or sores. During the exam you can expect your nurse or doctor to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Ask you about any past problems with your feet</li>\r\n    <li>Check your feet for numbness</li>\r\n    <li>Check for unusual foot shape</li>\r\n    <li>Check for blood flow problems&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What should you do if you have a diabetic foot ulcer?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nIf you are at high risk or have a foot ulcer, you may need a more detailed exam and special treatment. Find out more from experts in diabetes, footcare and other healthcare areas.

If it is not treated, high blood sugar (glucose) levels can cause heart disease and kidney problems. It can also cause vision problems, nerve damage, amputations, and problems with sexual function.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">There are 3 main types of diabetes: </font></strong></em> <strong>Type 1:</strong> 10% of people with diabetes have this type. The body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a substance that helps the body produce energy from the food we eat. Type 1 diabetes is often found at a young age. People with this type need insulin shots as part of the treatment. <br />\r\n<strong>Type 2:</strong> Affects about 90% of people with diabetes. This occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin. It can also happen when the body does not make proper use of the insulin it does make. <br />\r\n<strong>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM):</strong> This type of diabetes lasts for a short period of time during pregnancy and affects 3.5% of pregnant women. This may put mother and baby at higher risk for getting diabetes later in life.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What are the signs and symptoms of diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nThese may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Thirst</li>\r\n    <li>Weight change (gain or loss)</li>\r\n    <li>Cuts and bruises that are slow to heal</li>\r\n    <li>Tingling or numbness in hands or feet</li>\r\n    <li>Getting or keeping an erection may be a problem</li>\r\n    <li>Frequent urination</li>\r\n    <li>Very tired (no energy)</li>\r\n    <li>Blurred vision</li>\r\n    <li>Frequent infections</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>People with type 2 diabetes may not show any or all of these signs. Finding out you have diabetes early is important so that steps can be taken to manage blood sugar levels and prevent or delay problems. It is important to have regular check ups with your doctor or nurse to maintain your health.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">How do you manage diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nYou can expect to live an active and healthy life if your blood sugar is well controlled. Learn more about diabetes by talking to your family doctor, nurse or diet expert. <br />\r\nYour healthcare team can help you to make healthy choices. These healthy choices may include: <br />\r\n<strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Keep a healthy weight and stay active. Watch what you eat and how much you eat. Food plays a major role in how your body works to maintain blood sugar levels. You will need to make good food choices. Learn to reduce your stress level. <br />\r\n<strong>Medication:</strong> Treatment may involve the use of pills or a needle to assist your body in making or using insulin better. You may expect your nurse or other health expert to discuss how to prepare and give needles in a safe way. They will teach you how to prevent and treat low blood sugar. You will learn the early signs of a low sugar level and what to do when you are sick.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">Why is foot care important when managing your diabetes?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nFoot troubles are one problem that may occur if diabetes is not well managed. Protect your feet by following these simple steps:<br />\r\n<strong> Check your feet daily:</strong> Look for redness, blisters or open areas. If you cannot do this yourself, have someone else check for you. <br />\r\n<strong>Protect your feet &ndash; wear shoes:</strong> Wear shoes that fit well, support your feet and are not too tight. Do not wear shoes that cause redness or sore areas. See a footwear expert if you are at high risk for foot problems. <br />\r\n<strong>Keep your skin clean and soft:</strong> Wash your feet often. Check that the water is not too hot before putting your feet in. Do not soak them. Dry well between your toes. Use unscented creams. Do not put cream between your toes. <br />\r\n<strong>Don&rsquo;t hurt yourself with nail clippers or razors:</strong> Cut your nails straight across. Get help to cut your nails, if needed. Do not cut hard or callused areas. Go to a local foot care clinic.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">How often should I have a check up?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nYou should have a yearly foot exam. This will help spot any foot problems that may increase your risk of having foot ulcers or sores. During the exam you can expect your nurse or doctor to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Ask you about any past problems with your feet</li>\r\n    <li>Check your feet for numbness</li>\r\n    <li>Check for unusual foot shape</li>\r\n    <li>Check for blood flow problems &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What should you do if you have a diabetic foot ulcer?</font></strong></em><br />\r\nIf you are at high risk or have a foot ulcer, you may need a more detailed exam and special treatment. <br />\r\nFind out more from experts in diabetes, footcare and other healthcare areas.

In order to latch the baby, the mother may support her breast with the hand opposite the side that the baby is nursing, with her thumb and fingers well back from the areola. Using the arm on the same side the baby is nursing on, the mother supports the baby&rsquo;s head and body and keeps the infant close. The baby should be at the level of the breast, and pillows are useful to provide additional support. The mother turns the baby towards her so that the infant&rsquo;s nose, chin, tummy and knees are touching her. The mother can tuck the infant&rsquo;s lower arm below her breast to keep it out of the way.</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"264\" height=\"272\" src=\"database/images/breast1.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Modified Cradle-Hold</font></h4>\r\n<p>The mother should be seated comfortably with additional pillows as necessary to support her back and arms then tuck the baby under breast. Use of a footstool may be beneficial. The mother can support her breast with fingers positioned at the base of her breast well back from the areola. The baby should be held in the arm opposite to the breast being used. The baby&rsquo;s shoulder and neck are supported by her hand and the baby is turned facing the mother. Holding the back of the infant&rsquo;s head with her hand may cause the infant to pull away when being put onto the breast. The baby&rsquo;s head and neck should be in a slightly extended position to facilitate the chin touching the breast (Biancuzzo, 1999; Lothian, 1995).</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"264\" height=\"270\" src=\"database/images/breast2.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Side-Lying</font></h4>\r\n<p>The mother should lie on her side with one or two pillows supporting her head and her lower arm flexed up. Use pillows as necessary to support her back and legs. The baby should be positioned side-lying, facing the mother, with the head low enough that the mom&rsquo;s nipple is at the level of the baby&rsquo;s nose, and the neck extended so that eye contact with the mother is possible <i>(Scarborough Breastfeeding Network, 1999; Society of Paediatric Nursing of the Royal College of Nursing, 1998)</i>. The mother&rsquo;s hand should be across baby&rsquo;s shoulder blades. The mother should pull the baby towards her abdomen, and wait. The baby will extend his head with a wide mouth and will latch onto the breast without assistance.</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"264\" height=\"216\" src=\"database/images/breast3.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Football Hold (Clutch Hold)</font></h4>\r\n<p>The mother should be seated comfortably as per the &lsquo;cradle-hold&rsquo; description. The baby should be positioned on a pillow at the mother&rsquo;s side, on the side of the breast to be used. Use extra pillows to raise baby to the level of the breast. The baby should be tucked in close to the mother&rsquo;s side and held like a football with the bottom against the back of the chair and the legs up behind mother&rsquo;s arm <i>(Scarborough Breastfeeding Network, 1999; Society of Paediatric Nursing of the Royal College of Nursing, 1998)</i>. The baby&rsquo;s back should be supported with the mother&rsquo;s arm and his shoulders with mother&rsquo;s hand (avoid holding baby&rsquo;s head).</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"264\" height=\"247\" src=\"database/images/breast4.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p><i>Illustrations reproduced with the permission of the City of Ottawa.</i></p>","title":"Breastfeeding Positions","taxonomy":{"7":{"name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","weight":"4","tid":"7","vid":"2","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content."},"27":{"name":"Breastfeeding Guidelines for Nurses","weight":"0","tid":"27","vid":"1","description":""}}},"timestamp":"1266425357","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=314"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1290015656","body":"<p>View pg. 85 of http://www.rnao.org/Storage/11/564_BPG_Breastfeeding.pdf</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"500\" alt=\"\" src=\"database/images/pg85.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p>Note: <em>This tool has been provided as an example only, it has not been tested for reliability or validity</em></p>","title":"Prenatal Assessment Tool","taxonomy":{"6":{"name":"Sample Tools","weight":"3","tid":"6","vid":"2","description":"All of the Sample Tools content."},"27":{"name":"Breastfeeding Guidelines for Nurses","weight":"0","tid":"27","vid":"1","description":""}}},"timestamp":"1290015656","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=313"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1290011496","body":"<p>View pg. 100-104 of http://www.rnao.org/Storage/11/564_BPG_Breastfeeding.pdf <a name=\"top\">&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p><img width=\"500\" alt=\"\" src=\"database/images/pg100.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p><img width=\"500\" alt=\"\" src=\"database/images/pg101.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p><img width=\"500\" alt=\"\" src=\"database/images/pg102.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p><img width=\"500\" alt=\"\" src=\"database/images/pg103.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p><img width=\"500\" alt=\"\" src=\"database/images/pg104.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></p>","title":"Discharge Assessment Tool","taxonomy":{"6":{"name":"Sample Tools","weight":"3","tid":"6","vid":"2","description":"All of the Sample Tools content."},"27":{"name":"Breastfeeding Guidelines for Nurses","weight":"0","tid":"27","vid":"1","description":""}}},"timestamp":"1290011496","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=312"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1290011622","body":"<p><img width=\"500\" height=\"583\" alt=\"\" src=\"database/images/ppdectree.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p><i>Immediate Postpartum Descision Tree.

This may be the result of &ldquo;valves&rdquo; in the veins that are not working properly (allowing blood to &ldquo;pool&rdquo; in the lower leg).</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">Here are some more facts:</font></em> </strong><br />\r\nVenous leg ulcers can occur in both men and women; and may develop as a result of any injury to the leg or conditions such as varicose vein, blood clot in the leg, multiple pregnancies, overweight and standing for long periods of time (e.g., job related situations). They can take a long time to heal and are costly to treat. Venous leg ulcers can also cause you to not be able to move and get around. In addition, they may cause you pain, fear, anger, and depression.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">Signs and symptoms may include:</font> </em></strong><br />\r\nSwollen legs; change in skin colour to a brownish/red; burning or itching sensation; rash, redness or dry, crusty skin. An ulcer is often wet or weeping, and may have a yellow-white film covering it. Venous leg ulcers are usually located just above the ankle.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">Caring for your leg ulcer:</font></em></strong><em> </em><br />\r\nCaring for your leg ulcer includes good general health, a healthy diet, careful cleaning and dressing of the wound and use of special leg bandages, called compression bandages. The bandages must be applied by a trained nurse or physician. </p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nYou may need help from different healthcare providers as well as help at home. A physician or specially trained nurse will ensure proper assessment, which includes a physical examination, health history and a simple test called a Doppler ultrasound to measure the blood flow to your legs. </p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIf there is good blood flow to your legs, there are treatment options available to help heal your leg ulcer. Some of the treatment options are removal of the damaged tissue, appropriate dressings and wearing compression bandages or compression stockings. Compression works by helping the muscles to squeeze and push the blood back up through the veins and reduce swelling in the lower leg.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><font color=\"#006666\">What can you do to prevent venous leg ulcers?</font></em></strong><br />\r\nThere are lots of things that you can do to help prevent venous leg ulcers. Here are some suggestions:<br />\r\n<b>Exercise regularly:</b> Walking is the best exercise to assist the calf muscle to push the blood back towards the heart. If you are unable to walk, do ankle exercise when at rest. This can be done by moving the ankle and foot in a circular motion to the right and then to the left. If you are standing for prolonged periods of time, shift your weight from foot to foot, or stand up on tiptoes and then lower back down again. Do this a few times.<br />\r\n<b>Position:</b> You must raise your legs as much as possible at all times. If you are in bed or lying on a couch, raise your feet so that they are higher than the level of your heart. Support your legs and feet with pillows. Do not cross your legs.<br />\r\n<b>Diet:</b> Eat a healthy balanced diet and maintain an appropriate weight for your height. Being overweight will put an extra strain on your veins.<br />\r\n<b>Smoking:</b> Cut down or even better, stop smoking as it may interfere with healing.
