This occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin. It can also happen when the body does not make proper use of the insulin it does make. <br />\r\n<strong>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM):</strong> This type of diabetes lasts for a short period of time during pregnancy and affects 3.5% of pregnant women.

Watch what you eat and how much you eat. <br />\r\nFood plays a major role in how your body works to maintain blood sugar levels. You will need to make good food choices. Learn to reduce your stress level. <br />\r\n<strong>Medication:</strong> Treatment may involve the use of pills or a needle to assist your body in making or using  insulin better. You may expect your nurse or other health expert to discuss how to prepare and give needles in a safe way. They will teach you how to prevent and treat low blood sugar. You will learn the early signs of a low sugar level and what to do when you are sick.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em>Why is foot care important when managing your diabetes?</em></font></strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em> </em></font><br />\r\nFoot troubles are one problem that may occur if diabetes is not well managed. Protect your feet by following these simple steps: <br />\r\n<strong>Check your feet daily:</strong> Look for redness, blisters or open areas. If you cannot do this yourself, have someone else check for you. <br />\r\n<strong>Protect your feet &ndash; wear shoes:</strong> Wear shoes that fit well, support your feet and are not too tight. Do not wear shoes that cause redness or sore areas. See a footwear expert if you are at high risk for foot problems. <br />\r\n<strong>Keep your skin clean and soft:</strong> Wash your feet often. Check that the water is not too hot before putting your feet in. Do not soak them. Dry well between your toes. Use unscented creams. Do not put cream between your toes. <br />\r\n<strong>Don&rsquo;t hurt yourself with nail clippers or razors:</strong> Cut your nails straight across. Get help to cut your nails, if needed. Do not cut hard or callused areas. Go to a local foot care clinic.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em>How often should I have a check up?</em></font></strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em> </em></font><br />\r\nYou should have a yearly foot exam. This will help spot any foot problems that may increase your risk of having foot ulcers or sores. During the exam you can expect your nurse or doctor to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Ask you about any past problems with your feet&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Check your feet for numbness</li>\r\n    <li>Check for unusual foot shape&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Check for blood flow problems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><font color=\"#006666\"><em>What should you do if you have a diabetic foot ulcer? </em></font></strong><br />\r\nIf you are at high risk or have a foot ulcer, you may need a more detailed exam and special treatment. Find out more from experts in diabetes, footcare and other healthcare areas. The Canadian Diabetes Association, and Diabetes Centres are also a great resource. <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>","title":"Health Education Fact Sheet","taxonomy":{"7":{"name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","weight":"4","tid":"7","vid":"2","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content."},"23":{"name":"Subcutaneous Administration of Insulin in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes","weight":"0","tid":"23","vid":"1","description":"Insulin BPG"}}},"timestamp":"1262538709","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=245"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1297199521","body":"<p>The following websites provide information on diabetes.

With the current understanding of the importance of glucose management for complication prevention in type 2 diabetes, insulin therapy is being considered as an early treatment option. Insulin therapy is no longer the treatment of last resort, but may be a proactive choice for many people (Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA), 2003a; Meltzer et al., 1998).</p>\r\n<p>There are three main forms of diabetes:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Type 1 diabetes affects approximately 10% of all people with diabetes and is primarily a result of an inability to produce insulin due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells. It is often diagnosed at a young age and requires insulin treatment. People with type 1 diabetes are susceptible to diabetic ketoacidosis if they do not take the required insulin.</li>\r\n    <li>Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 90% of those diagnosed with diabetes and results from a combination of insufficient insulin production and/or insulin resistance at the cell level.</li>\r\n    <li>Gestational diabetes (GDM) is diagnosed during pregnancy and affects 3.5 to 3.8% in the non-Aboriginal population (CDA, 2003a). Up to 40% of women who have had GDM will develop type 2 diabetes as they age (Health Canada, 2002).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Type 2 diabetes is considered to be a progressive condition. Many individuals develop secondary failure on oral antihyperglycemic agents, which means that eventually insulin is required. Approximately 50% of all clients with type 2 diabetes eventually require insulin therapy to maintain optimal glycemic control (DeWitt &amp; Hirsch, 2003; Grissinger &amp; Lease, 2003; Turner, Cull, Frighi, Holman, &amp; UKPDS Group, 1999).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","title":"Background about Diabetes","taxonomy":{"23":{"name":"Subcutaneous Administration of Insulin in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes","weight":"0","tid":"23","vid":"1","description":"Insulin BPG"},"3":{"name":"Pre-reading","weight":"0","tid":"3","vid":"2","description":"All of the pre-reading content pages."}}},"timestamp":"1262536653","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=236"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1263581034","body":"<p>Place Link Here</p>","title":"Health Education Fact Sheet","taxonomy":[]},"timestamp":"1263581034","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=235"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1271957097","body":"<ul>\r\n    <li>College of Nurses of Ontario.

These are different conditions and are not part of normal aging. However, it is hard to recognize the differences in the older adult because many of the symptoms and behaviours can occur together. It is important to realize that you can seek help in recognizing the differences and find suggestions for care.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">Are you or a loved one experiencing the following?</font></strong></em><br />\r\n<strong>Delirium</strong> (acute confusion) is a change in your ability to think clearly, to plan your usual day, to pay attention or to remember a few days or hours ago. It usually happens quite quickly over a short period of time (several hours or days) and is temporary, lasting for a few hours or several weeks. Delirium has many different causes and these may include: severe infections; high fever; lack of fluids; diseases of the kidney or liver; lack of certain vitamins; seizures; lack of oxygen; head injury; reaction to certain medications or alcohol. It can also occur after surgery or sometimes after a fall. A delirious person may be confused about where they are or what time of day or year it is. Things may be seen or heard that are not there. Older people with delirium may have mood swings that can be frightening.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Dementia</strong> is the gradual loss in memory (ability to think, reason, remember and plan) and the ability to carry out one&rsquo;s daily activities. It usually starts slower than delirium, over many months and may appear as a loss in thinking and doing your normal activities. It is different for each person. Aging itself does not cause dementia but it is more common among older adults. One of the most common types of dementia is Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. The symptoms of dementia may include: memory loss that affects daily activities (e.g., dressing, grooming); difficulty performing tasks (e.g., banking, driving, brushing teeth); problem with language, poor or decreased judgment; misplacing things (e.g., &ldquo;someone took them&rdquo;); changes in mood, behaviour and/or personality; disorientation to time and place; getting lost; loss of initiative (e.g., often better if someone tells you what to do); difficulty with balance while walking.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Depression </strong>is the most common mental health concern in the older adults. Depression often occurs at the time of a major life change such as a loss of a spouse. Signs of depression may include: cutting back on enjoyable activities (e.g., losing interest); changes in appetite and weight (e.g., loss of interest in eating or eating more). Changes in sleep pattern (e.g., awake during the night and are not able to fall asleep again) is another warning sign. You may feel a lack of energy or always feel tired, even if you have slept. Depression that is not treated can result in physical illness, substance abuse, loneliness and suicide.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What can you do for yourself,or for someone you know who may be experiencing signs of delirium,dementia or depression?</font></strong> </em><br />\r\nAny older person who shows the signs and symptoms discussed above has the right to a timely and thorough geriatric/mental health evaluation and treatment. <em>Contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible!</em> Careful screening for these disorders leads to early understanding and treatment.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What kind of screening and treatment can you expect?</font></strong></em> <br />\r\nYou should expect a thorough assessment that includes a variety of tests and meeting with different members of the healthcare team. This may include a geriatrician, a physician who specializes in care of older people. A family member or your caregiver may also be asked to be part of the screening process. Treatment options will focus on identifying risk for injury and strengthening your abilities.

Exhale during the strenuous part of an activity and use pursed-lip and diaphragmatic breathing.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Eliminate Unnecessary Activities</b>: For instance, use a terry robe after showering to avoid the work of drying yourself, and allow dishes to air dry after washing. Sit for as many activities as possible. Sitting uses 25% less energy than standing.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Get Assistance</b>: Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for assistance when necessary. Some jobs may be too difficult to do alone. Or, there may be a task that you dislike doing, and which someone else may enjoy doing for you. Asking for help does not mean you are dependent; it means you are using your energy to its best advantage.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Organize Your Time</b>: Plan daily and weekly schedules so you are doing the most energy-consuming activities at the time of day or time of week when you have the most energy. Alternate difficult and easy tasks. Take planned rest periods. Keep your schedule flexible and allow for the unexpected.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Organize Your Methods</b>: Repetition of new methods will allow things to become automatic, and the more proficient you are, the more energy you save.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Organize Your Space</b>: Organize your most used items in drawers or shelves that are between waist and shoulder level, so you won&rsquo;t have to stoop or stretch to reach them. Keep items in the area in which they are used, in order to avoid unnecessary walking and carrying.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Pace Yourself</b>: A slow, steady pace consumes less energy. Do one activity at a time and use slow, smooth movements. Rushing only increases discomfort. Be certain to alternate periods of work and rest. Try to plan out your activities in steps, so if you start to get short of breath you can stop and rest when necessary, instead of working faster and harder in order to finish.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Maintain a Good Posture</b>: One of the easiest ways to save energy is to use your body properly. When the body is in proper alignment, less effort is required to maintain that posture. Avoid bending. Avoid lifting. Push, pull or slide instead. If you must lift and carry, lift with your legs, use both hands and carry close to your body. Be certain to choose a work height whereby you can maintain good posture and eliminate strain from any segment of the body. Experimenting at different heights by adjusting either the height of the chair or the work surface is the best method of deciding which height is the most comfortable.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Relax</b>: Relaxation can help restore energy. Sit in a comfortable chair with your back supported, shoulders relaxed, arms resting in your lap with elbows slightly bent and palms up and feet flat on the floor.&nbsp; Concentrate on relaxing your muscles and slowing down your breathing. Remember: tension only uses energy!</li>\r\n    <li><b>Use Proper Equipment</b>: Use the right tool to do the job. For example, use long-handled equipment to avoid reaching or bending, use equipment to stabilize items in order to avoid holding, and use trolleys or bundle buggies to do your carrying.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","title":"Energy Conservation Tips","taxonomy":{"20":{"name":"Nursing Care of Dyspnea: The 6th Vital Sign in Individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) ","weight":"0","tid":"20","vid":"1","description":"COPD BPG"},"5":{"name":"At Point of Care","weight":"2","tid":"5","vid":"2","description":"All of the point of care page content."}}},"timestamp":"1260297115","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=204"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1260297312","body":"<p>Secretion clearance consists of deep breathing, controlled coughing and huffing.</p>\r\n<p>Deep breathing: Do deep breathing exercises 4 to 5 times a day, sitting or standing.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Relax your shoulders.</li>\r\n    <li>Take a deep breath in through your nose.</li>\r\n    <li>Breathe out slowly through your nose.</li>\r\n    <li>Breathe out longer than you breathe in.</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Count to 1 when you breathe in.</li>\r\n    <li>Count to 3 when you breathe out.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n    <li>Repeat 5 deep breaths as above and rest.</li>\r\n    <li>Try 5 more deep breaths in and out and rest.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Try blowing the air out through pursed-lips.

These figures likely underestimate the true prevalence of COPD because a diagnosis is often not made until the patient is over 55 years of age and has advanced changes in the lung tissue. Furthermore, studies have estimated more than 50% of patients with COPD remain undiagnosed in the community (Calverley &amp; Bellamy, 2000).</p>\r\n<h2>Dyspnea and COPD</h2>\r\n<p>Similar to pain, often referred to as the fifth vital sign (McCaffrey &amp; Pasero, 1997; 1998; RNAO, 2002a), Dyspnea should be understood as the sixth vital sign for individuals living with COPD. Dyspnea, the subjective experience of breathlessness (Gift, 1990; 1993; GOLD Scientific Committee, 2003; 2004), is the most disabling symptom of COPD. As a progressive respiratory disorder, COPD is characterized by progressive airway obstruction precipitating ongoing dyspnea and systemic manifestations including peripheral muscle dysfunction, right heart failure, polycythemia and changes in nutritional status. Although smoking is the major risk factor, much is yet unknown about the causes of COPD (GOLD Scientific Committee, 2003; 2004; O&rsquo;Donnell et al., 2003).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","title":"Background - Dyspnea and COPD","taxonomy":{"3":{"name":"Pre-reading","weight":"0","tid":"3","vid":"2","description":"All of the pre-reading content pages."},"20":{"name":"Nursing Care of Dyspnea: The 6th Vital Sign in Individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) ","weight":"0","tid":"20","vid":"1","description":"COPD BPG"}}},"timestamp":"1260411862","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=190"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1269961619","body":"<p><strong>1.0</strong> Nurses provide individualized, flexible postpartum care based on the identification of depressive symptoms and maternal preference.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.0</strong> Nurses initiate preventive strategies in the early postpartum period.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","title":"Prevention","taxonomy":{"19":{"name":"Interventions for Postpartum Depression","weight":"0","tid":"19","vid":"1","description":"Postpartum Depression BPG"},"4":{"name":"Practice Reference – Evidence Informed Recommendations","weight":"1","tid":"4","vid":"2","description":"All of the content for Practice Reference."}}},"timestamp":"1269961619","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=189"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1260294388","body":"<h2>Internet Sources<a name=\"top\"></a></h2>\r\n<p>Depression After Delivery: www.depressionafterdelivery.com</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Provides information and education for women and families affected by postpartum depression.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Helpformom: www.helpformom.ca</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Offers public and professional awareness of postpartum depression along with access to a variety of community agencies in the London, Ontario area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Maternal and Child Health: www.mchlibrary.info/KnowledgePaths/kp_postpartum.html</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Compilation of information, resources, and links for health professionals and consumers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Mood Disorders Society of Canada: www.mooddisorderscanada.ca</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Offers awareness, education, advocacy, and research.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Motherisk: www.motherisk.org</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Professional information about the safety or risk of drugs, chemicals and disease during pregnancy and lactation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Our Sisters&rsquo; Place: www.oursistersplace.ca</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Provides information/support for women with mood disorders related to hormonal changes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Pacific Postpartum Support Society: <a href=\"http://www.postpartum.org\">www.postpartum.org</a></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Offers support and information for women with postpartum depression and their families.

Some of these feelings are joy and excitement, or guilt and sadness. This is quite normal after such an important event! Sometimes unhappy feelings become so difficult that a mother feels overwhelmed and out of control. If this happens, a woman may be suffering from postpartum depression and anxiety.</p>\r\n<h4>What are Postpartum Depression and Anxiety?</h4>\r\n<p>They are emotional problems which may happen to a mother after her baby is born. One mother in five experiences depression and anxiety after birth. These problems are more common than many people think. Every mother is different and may have different symptoms. These symptoms may happen shortly after birth or many months later.</p>\r\n<h4>What are the Symptoms?</h4>\r\n<p>Most women feel:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Sad</li>\r\n    <li>Angry</li>\r\n    <li>Guilty</li>\r\n    <li>Alone</li>\r\n    <li>Worried</li>\r\n    <li>Inadequate</li>\r\n    <li>Irritable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other feelings are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Wanting to run away</li>\r\n    <li>Not being able to cope</li>\r\n    <li>Exhaustion &ndash; not being able to sleep even when the baby sleeps</li>\r\n    <li>Isolation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A mother who is new to Canada may also feel:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Lonely because her family and friends are far away</li>\r\n    <li>Unfamiliar with the Canadian healthcare system</li>\r\n    <li>The absence of familiar comforts, traditions and rituals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These feelings last for two weeks or more, and do not go away by themselves. This is a different situation than the &ldquo;baby blues&rdquo; (fatigue and tearfulness). The &ldquo;baby blues&rdquo; may appear shortly after birth and disappear on their own. A mother may have &ldquo;scary&rdquo; thoughts of harming the baby or herself. These thoughts may increase if the mother is overtired or stressed. A doctor should be consulted.</p>\r\n<h4>What Causes Postpartum Depression and Anxiety?</h4>\r\n<p>The causes are not completely understood. Some causes may be:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Hormonal and chemical changes in the body</li>\r\n    <li>Stress and lack of support</li>\r\n    <li>Adjusting to motherhood</li>\r\n    <li>A history of emotional, physical or sexual abuse may be a factor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Why Do So Many Women Suffer in Silence?</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>They may hide their feelings.</li>\r\n    <li>They may feel ashamed and guilty.</li>\r\n    <li>Health care professionals may not recognize the depression or anxiety.</li>\r\n    <li>Partners and families may not take the situation seriously.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>What Can Help?</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Speak to a healthcare provider, family member, friend or counsellor.</li>\r\n    <li>Ask for the location of a postpartum support program.</li>\r\n    <li>Make sure that the mother gets enough food and rest.</li>\r\n    <li>Understand that this is not the mother&rsquo;s fault.</li>\r\n    <li>Accept and understand that a new mother cannot do everything.</li>\r\n    <li>Ask for help from others.</li>\r\n    <li>Be willing to try things that may be unfamiliar such as counselling, group support, or medication.</li>\r\n    <li>Take one day at a time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","title":"Depression and Anxiety after Birth Resource Sheet","taxonomy":{"7":{"name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","weight":"4","tid":"7","vid":"2","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content."},"19":{"name":"Interventions for Postpartum Depression","weight":"0","tid":"19","vid":"1","description":"Postpartum Depression BPG"}}},"timestamp":"1269961778","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=186"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1260290237","body":"<p>Although all women are susceptible to developing depression following childbirth, women who have one or more of the following factors have a significantly increased risk of experiencing postpartum depression.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Strong to Moderate Risk:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Depression during pregnancy.</li>\r\n    <li>Anxiety during pregnancy.</li>\r\n    <li>Stressful recent life events.</li>\r\n    <li>Lack of social support (either perceived or received).</li>\r\n    <li>Previous history of depression.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Moderate Risk:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>High levels of childcare stress.</li>\r\n    <li>Low self-esteem.</li>\r\n    <li>Neuroticism.</li>\r\n    <li>Difficult infant temperment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Small Risk:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Obstetric and pregnancy complications.</li>\r\n    <li>Cognitive attributions.</li>\r\n    <li>Quality of relationship with partner.</li>\r\n    <li>Socioeconomic status.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>No effect:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Ethnicity.</li>\r\n    <li>Maternal age.</li>\r\n    <li>Level of education.</li>\r\n    <li>Parity.</li>\r\n    <li>Gender of child (within Western societies).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","title":"Other Risk Factor for Postpartum Depression Resource Sheet","taxonomy":{"19":{"name":"Interventions for Postpartum Depression","weight":"0","tid":"19","vid":"1","description":"Postpartum Depression BPG"},"5":{"name":"At Point of Care","weight":"2","tid":"5","vid":"2","description":"All of the point of care page content."}}},"timestamp":"1260290237","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=185"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1260293724","body":"<p>Some women have thoughts or images about harming themselves.&nbsp;

They can develop in a very short time period and take longer to heal. They may have a huge impact on your every day life, as normal activities can be restricted while the ulcer heals. Healing these ulcers can be costly to you and the healthcare system.</p>\r\n<p>If you spend long periods of time in a bed, chair or wheelchair and have lost your feeling in your lower body, you maybe at increased risk of getting pressure ulcers. In most cases, pressure ulcers can be prevented. If they do occur, they can be healed.</p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>How do pressure ulcers develop?</strong></em></font> <br />\r\nThere are a number of risk factors that lead to pressure ulcers. Some of the factors include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Limitation in movement (e.g., paralysis, acute/chronic illness or surgery).</li>\r\n    <li>Incontinence (loss of bowel and/or bladder control).</li>\r\n    <li>Not having a well-balanced diet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>Facts about pressure ulcers:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The first sign of a pressure ulcer is reddened skin on fair skinned individuals or purplish/bluish discolouration in darker individuals. It may not be painful.</li>\r\n    <li>A very ill person may develop a pressure ulcer quickly.</li>\r\n    <li>Persons who are confined to a bed may develop ulcers on areas that they lie on such as the tailbone, buttocks (bottom), heels, hips, ankles, shoulder blades, back of the head, ears, elbows and knees. Pressure ulcers may also develop on the buttocks (bottom) of persons who are sitting in a chair or wheelchair for a long time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>What can you do to prevent or reduce your risk of developing pressure ulcers? If you are confined to bed:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Remember that you can best help yourself. Change your position frequently by turning your body. Do this at least every 2 hours. If you cannot move on your own, have someone assist you.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid lying on your hip. Instead, turn to your side and support yourself</li>\r\n    <li>with pillows.</li>\r\n    <li>Use pillows or foam wedges to avoid contact between bony areas. Use devices such as heel protectors that will reduce pressure on the heels and ankles. November 2003</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><strong><em>If you are confined to chair or wheelchair:</em></strong></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Shift your weight every 15 minutes. If you cannot shift your weight, have someone move you at least every hour.</li>\r\n    <li>Do not create your own cushion (e.g., donut type devices) as it will likely just move pressure to a new area. Instead, use pressure-reducing devices. There are many pressure-reducing products designed for seating surfaces to choose from. An occupational therapist or physiotherapist can suggest an appropriate seating device based on your needs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><strong><em>If you are a caregiver for someone who is at risk of developing pressure ulcer,here are some helpful suggestions for you:</em></strong></font> Use lifting devices to move the person during transfer and position changes. Keep the skin and bony areas from rubbing on surfaces. Talk to a nurse, occupational therapist, physiotherapist or doctor regarding the use of transfer techniques, and how to obtain lifting devices and pressure reducing/relieving devices. <em><strong>(Caution:The use of pressure reducing/relieving devices does not substitute for an appropriate turning schedule.)</strong></em> If pain is an issue discuss with the nurse or doctor about ways to manage the pain.</p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>More Tips:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Use a mild cleansing product that is pH balanced when bathing and after an episode of incontinence. Use a product which is both a moisturizer and skin barrier protection against moisture to re-hydrate dry skin and to improve resistance to injury.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid massaging bony areas.</li>\r\n    <li>Eat a balanced diet. Eat fruits, vegetables and foods high in protein and calories. Drink plenty of fluids. If you cannot handle a balanced diet, ask your nurse, doctor or dietitian about nutritional supplements. Consult your doctor about the use of multivitamin tablets.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>What can you do if you develop a pressure ulcer?</strong></em></font>\r\nWith proper treatment, most pressure ulcers will heal. Healing of pressure ulcers depends on your general health, diet, relieving pressure on the ulcer and careful cleaning and dressing of the wound. Healing wounds also requires a team effort that includes healthcare experts, you and your caregiver. The treatment plan will be based on the results of a wound assessment, a physical exam and health history.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","title":"Health Education Fact Sheet","taxonomy":{"7":{"name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","weight":"4","tid":"7","vid":"2","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content."},"16":{"name":"Assessment and Management of Stage I to IV Pressure Ulcers","weight":"0","tid":"16","vid":"1","description":"Pressure Ulcer Assessment BPG"}}},"timestamp":"1259701208","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=157"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1259702554","body":"<p>Clinicians and educators will find the following resources useful on various levels.

The following table provides a comparison of pH values as an illustration of this concept (Stranz, 2002).</p>\r\n<h2>pH - Blood pH = 7.35 &ndash; 7.45</h2>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n    <li>A pH of 5 &ndash; 9 minimizes       disruption of venous endothelium (INS,       2000).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<table width=\"364\" cellspacing=\"4\" cellpadding=\"4\" border=\"1\">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th bgcolor=\"#006666\">&nbsp;</th>\r\n            <th bgcolor=\"#006666\" class=\"rtecenter\"><font color=\"#ffffff\">pH</font></th>\r\n            <th bgcolor=\"#006666\" class=\"rtecenter\"><font color=\"#ffffff\">Example</font></th>\r\n            <th bgcolor=\"#006666\" class=\"rtecenter\"><font color=\"#ffffff\">Drug</font></th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Acid</td>\r\n            <td align=\"center\">1</td>\r\n            <td>Stomach acid</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n            <td align=\"center\">2</td>\r\n            <td>Lemon juice</td>\r\n            <td>Vancomycin = 2.4</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n            <td align=\"center\">3</td>\r\n            <td>Vinegar</td>\r\n            <td>Ciprofloxacin = 3.3 &ndash; 4.6<br />\r\n            Tobramycin = 3 &ndash; 6.5</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Neutral</td>\r\n            <td align=\"center\">7</td>\r\n            <td>Tap water</td>\r\n            <td>Erythromycin = 6.5 &ndash; 7.7</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Base</td>\r\n            <td align=\"center\">11</td>\r\n            <td>Ammonia</td>\r\n            <td>Acyclovir = 10.5 &ndash; 11.6</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n            <td align=\"center\">12</td>\r\n            <td>Mineral lime Ca(OH)2</td>\r\n            <td>Phenytoin (Dilantin) = 12</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n            <td align=\"center\">13</td>\r\n            <td>Draino&reg;</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p class=\"reference\"><em>Reference: Stranz, M. (2002). Adjusting pH and osmolarity levels to fit standards and practices. Journal of<br />\r\nVascular Access Devices. Fall, 12-17</em></p>\r\n<h2>Osmolality</h2>\r\n<p>The concentration of particles dissolved in each solution is referred to as its osmolality. In human plasma, the concentration of dissolved particles is about 290 x 103 M, so its osmolality is 290 mOsm/L (Stranz, 2002).</p>\r\n<p>Separate solutions containing the same amount of particles are called iso-osmotic. The term isotonic is used interchangeably with the term iso-osmotic. Normal saline is iso-osmotic/isotonic with blood and the venous endothelium. Solutions containing fewer particles (lower osmolality) than normal saline are called hypotonic. Administration of hypotonic solutions results in fluid moving into the more concentrated venous endothelial cells and blood cells.</p>\r\n<p>Solutions containing more particles (higher osmolality) are called hypertonic. When hypertonic solutions are administered, they draw fluid from the endothelium and blood cells, resulting in the cells shrinking and being more susceptible to damage (Stranz, 2002).</p>\r\n<h2>Vesicant Drugs</h2>\r\n<p>The following list includes some commonly administered vesicant drugs capable of causing injury when the drug escapes from the intended vascular pathway into surrounding tissue (INS, 2000).

In fact, 6 in 10 people with asthma have poor asthma control, and as a result restrict their everyday activities and suffer needlessly. The goal of asthma care is to provide you with freedom from symptoms and a normal, active lifestyle.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What is asthma?</font></strong></em> Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways &ndash; common symptoms include shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing and/or coughing. Asthma attacks may begin suddenly, or symptoms may slowly get worse over a period of time.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">What causes asthma?</font></strong></em> The exact cause of asthma is not known. However, there are several factors that may play a part in the development of asthma. These include a tendency to have allergic reactions to things in your environment, a family history of asthma or allergies, and exposure to second hand smoke. Things that can trigger an asthma attack include irritants such as tobacco smoke, pollution, and exercise. Allergies to substances such as pollen, moulds, dust mites, pet dander and certain foods can trigger an attack, as can viral infections, colds, and certain drugs.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Assessing asthma control:</strong>You can expect your nurse or other healthcare provider to ask you some basic questions, such as: <em>&ldquo;Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have asthma?&rdquo;</em>or <em>&ldquo;Have you ever used a puffer/inhaler or asthma medication for breathing problems?&rdquo;</em>.Your level of asthma control should be assessed if you have <br />\r\nbeen identified as having asthma (or are suspected of having asthma). <br />\r\nGood asthma control is achieved when:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>you are using your &ldquo;short-acting&rdquo; puffer less than 4 times per week (unless for exercise);</li>\r\n    <li>you are having daytime asthma symptoms less than four times per week;</li>\r\n    <li>you are having night time asthma symptoms less than once per week;</li>\r\n    <li>you have normal physical activity levels;</li>\r\n    <li>you have no absence from work or school related to your asthma; and</li>\r\n    <li>asthma attacks are infrequent and mild.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Asthma medications:</strong> You should anticipate that your nurse or other healthcare provider will discuss your asthma medications with you to make sure that you understand their purpose and use. You should also expect that you will be asked to demonstrate your puffer/inhaler technique to make sure that you are using your delivery device properly. If you need help in using your puffer/inhaler, ask your nurse for assistance.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Your Asthma Action Plan:</strong> If you have asthma, you should have a personal asthma action plan written by you and your asthma care providers. This plan will help you to monitor your asthma control and make changes to how you manage your asthma. Often asthma action plans use the image of a traffic light &ndash; a green, a yellow, and a red zone. The green zone describes good asthma control, and a &ldquo;go ahead&rdquo; with current therapy. The yellow zone describes a decrease in asthma control. In response to this loss of control, suggestions may be made to adjust medications and/or seek medical assistance. The red zone describes asthma that is out of control and severe enough to need urgent medical care.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Regular follow-up care:</strong> A key part of your asthma care includes follow-up visits with a healthcare provider who monitors your asthma. Your doctor may refer you to an asthma specialist if your diagnosis is in doubt, or if your asthma is out of control. There are also community resources for individuals with asthma that provide education and information that may be helpful for you in managing your asthma. Ask your nurse or other healthcare provider about services in your community. <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>","title":"Health Education Fact Sheet","taxonomy":{"7":{"name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","weight":"4","tid":"7","vid":"2","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content."},"13":{"name":"Adult Asthma Care Guidelines for Nurses: Promoting Control of Asthma","weight":"0","tid":"13","vid":"1","description":"Adult Asthma BPG"}}},"timestamp":"1268777429","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=119"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1258855319","body":"<p><b><span>Diskus&reg;: Proper Use</span></b></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><span><i>Open </i>&ndash; Place thumb on thumb grip.

Support systems must be assessed and accessed for every person in crisis.</p>\r\n<p>These include family support and accessibility, financial resources, and community and professional support networks.

drinks can cause irritability of the bladder causing urgency, frequency of urination and incontinence;</li>\r\n    <li>Not drinking enough fluids makes your urine more concentrated, which can irritate

Rather than relying on an incontinence aid or clothing, the caregiver will intervene prior to the undesired bladder voiding. An individualized prompted voiding schedule is determined using a 3-day voiding record that is based on the person&rsquo;s normal pattern of voiding and/or incontinence. Prompted voiding is used for the treatment of urinary incontinence in persons with physical and/or cognitive deficits, requiring timely reminders to toilet from caregivers. This intervention has been used successfully to treat urinary incontinence in acute and long-term care, as well as in home care settings (Lyons &amp; Pringle Specht, 1999).</p>\r\n<p>Each time prompted voiding is initiated, the care provider uses three primary behaviours:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> This involves asking the incontinent individual, at regular intervals, if he or she needs to use the toilet.

In most cases, constipation is temporary and not serious.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Fortunately, there are many ways to prevent constipation. Understanding the reasons for constipation is the first step. If you have chronic constipation, talk to your nurse, doctor or nutritionist.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><font color=\"#006666\">Here are some helpful hints.</font></strong></em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Drink sufficient fluids. Aim for 1&frac12;-2 litres of fluids daily (6 to 8, eight ounce glasses).</li>\r\n    <li>Reduce caffeinated (coffee, tea, some soft drinks) and alcoholic beverages whenever possible as they actually cause you to lose fluids.</li>\r\n    <li>Eat adequate dietary fiber in combination with a good fluid intake. Please note that dietary intake of fiber should be gradually increased once you are consistently taking 1&frac12;litres of fluid daily. A high fiber diet is not recommended in persons who are immobile (bedridden) or persons who do not drink at least 1&frac12;litres of fluids per day. Adequate dietary fibre can be achieved by consuming about 2 to 3 servings of grains and about 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Examples of dietary fiber include wheat bran, whole cereals such as wheat, rice, barley, rye, millets; fruits like mango and guava; and leafy vegetables such as cabbage, lettuce and celery. Fiber supplements in powder, tablet or granular form are also available. Consult your pharmacist.</li>\r\n    <li>Use routine consistent toileting each day based on your urge to have a bowel movement. Use a squat position to facilitate the bowel movement process.</li>\r\n    <li>Exercise such as walking (15 to 20 minutes once or twice a day) can stimulate the bowels.</li>\r\n    <li>If you are unable to walk or are bedridden, there are numerous exercises that you can do. Examples of such exercises include flattening the low back arch by tightening the abdominal muscles (pelvic tilt), rolling bent knees side to side twisting at the waist (low trunk rotation) and single leg lifts. Before starting on an exercise program, consult with a health care professionalc(your doctor or nurse).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","title":"Health Education Fact Sheet","taxonomy":{"7":{"name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","weight":"4","tid":"7","vid":"2","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content."},"10":{"name":"Prevention of Constipation in the Older Population","weight":"0","tid":"10","vid":"1","description":"Constipation BPG"}}},"timestamp":"1260416391","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=82"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1271954812","body":"<p><img width=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"database/images/bowel.pdf\" alt=\"\" />Below is an abbreviated form of the Sample Bowel Elimination Record.

They can develop in a very short time period and take longer to heal. They may have a huge impact on your every day life, as normal activities can be restricted while the ulcer heals. Healing these ulcers can be costly to you and the healthcare system. <br />\r\nIf you spend long periods of time in a bed, chair or wheelchair and have lost your feeling in your lower body, you maybe at increased risk of getting pressure ulcers. In most cases, pressure ulcers can be prevented. If they do occur, they can be healed.</p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>How do pressure ulcers develop? </strong></em></font> There are a number of risk factors that lead to pressure ulcers. Some of the factors include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Limitation in movement (e.g., paralysis, acute/chronic illness or surgery).</li>\r\n    <li>Incontinence (loss of bowel and/or bladder control).</li>\r\n    <li>Not having a well-balanced diet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>Facts about pressure ulcers: </strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The first sign of a pressure ulcer is reddened skin on fair skinned individuals or purplish/bluish discolouration in darker individuals. It may not be painful.</li>\r\n    <li>A very ill person may develop a pressure ulcer quickly.</li>\r\n    <li>Persons who are confined to a bed may develop ulcers on areas that they lie on such as the tailbone, buttocks (bottom), heels, hips, ankles, shoulder blades, back of the head, ears, elbows and knees. Pressure ulcers may also develop on the buttocks (bottom) of persons who are sitting in a chair or wheelchair for a long time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>What can you do to prevent or reduce your risk of developing pressure ulcers? <br />\r\nIf you are confined to bed:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Remember that you can best help yourself. Change your position frequently by turning your body. Do this at least every 2 hours. If you cannot move on your own, have someone assist you.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid lying on your hip. Instead, turn to your side and support yourself with pillows.</li>\r\n    <li>Use pillows or foam wedges to avoid contact between bony areas. Use devices such as heel protectors that will reduce pressure on the heels and ankles.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>If you are confined to chair or wheelchair:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Shift your weight every 15 minutes. If you cannot shift your weight, have someone move you at least every hour.</li>\r\n    <li>Do not create your own cushion (e.g., donut type devices) as it will likely just move pressure to a new area. Instead, use pressure-reducing devices. There are many pressure-reducing products designed for seating surfaces to choose from. An occupational therapist or a physiotherapist can suggest an appropriate seating device based on your needs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>If you are a caregiver for someone who is at risk of developing pressure ulcer,here are some helpful suggestions for you: </strong></em></font><br />\r\nUse lifting devices to move the person during transfer and position changes. Keep the skin and bony areas from rubbing on surfaces. Talk to a nurse, occupational therapist, physiotherapist or doctor regarding the use of transfer techniques, and how to obtain lifting devices and pressure reducing/relieving devices. <strong>(Caution:The use of pressure reducing/relieving devices does not substitute for an appropriate turning schedule.)</strong> If pain is an issue discuss with the nurse or doctor about ways to manage the pain.</p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><em><strong>More Tips:</strong></em></font></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Use a mild cleansing product that is pH balanced when bathing and after an episode of incontinence. Use a product which is both a moisturizer and skin barrier protection against moisture to re-hydrate dry skin and to improve resistance to injury.</li>\r\n    <li>Avoid massaging bony areas.</li>\r\n    <li>Eat a balanced diet. Eat fruits, vegetables and foods high in protein and calories. Drink plenty of fluids. If you cannot handle a balanced diet, ask your nurse, doctor or dietitian about nutritional supplements. Consult your doctor about the use of multivitamin tablets.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\"><strong><em>What can you do if you develop a pressure ulcer?</em></strong></font><br />\r\nWith proper treatment, most pressure ulcers will heal. Healing of pressure ulcers depends on your general health, diet, relieving pressure on the ulcer and careful cleaning and dressing of the wound. Healing wounds also requires a team effort that includes healthcare experts, you and your caregiver. The treatment plan will be based on the results of a wound assessment, a physical exam and health history.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","title":"Health Education Fact Sheet","taxonomy":{"7":{"name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","weight":"4","tid":"7","vid":"2","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content."},"9":{"name":"Risk Assessment and Prevention of Pressure Ulcers","weight":"0","tid":"9","vid":"1","description":"Pressure Ulcer BPG"}}},"timestamp":"1260898988","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=73"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1260891572","body":"<a name=\"top\"></a><p>The following resources for nurses are intended to assist in supporting pressure ulcer risk assessment and prevention education.\r\nThese are examples of resources only, and are not intended to be a comprehensive list.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.joannabriggs.edu.au/about/home.php\">Joanna Briggs Institute</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.rnao.org/\">Registered Nurses&acute; Association of Ontario</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.rcn.org.uk/\">Royal College of Nursing</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Wound Care Associations:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.caet.ca/\">Canadian Association of Enterostomal Therapists (CAET)</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.cawc.net/\">Canadian Association of Wound Care (CAWC)</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/gsp/themes/woundcare/Wounds\">Cochrane Wounds Group</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.epuap.org/\">European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP)</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.npuap.org/\">National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.wocn.org/\">Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society (WOCN)</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Wound Care Sites:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.o-wm.com/owm\">Ostomy/Wound Management</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.bradenscale.com/\">Prevention Plus</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.worldwidewounds.com/\">World Wide Wounds</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","title":"Educational Resources","taxonomy":{"7":{"name":"Client’s and Families’ Education","weight":"4","tid":"7","vid":"2","description":"All of the Client’s and Families’ Education content."},"9":{"name":"Risk Assessment and Prevention of Pressure Ulcers","weight":"0","tid":"9","vid":"1","description":"Pressure Ulcer BPG"}}},"timestamp":"1260891572","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=72"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1260892813","body":"<a name=\"top\"></a><ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#bpg\">Clinical Practice Guidelines or Best Practice Guidelines</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Consensus\">Consensus</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Education\">Education Recommendations</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Family\">Family</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Interdisciplinary\">Interdisciplinary</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Metaanalysis\">Meta-analysis</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Organization\">Organization and Policy Recommendations</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#PR\">Practice Recommendations</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Pressure\">Pressure (Interface Pressure)</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Redistribution\">Pressure Redistribution:</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Ulcers\">Pressure Ulcers</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Randomized\">Randomized Controlled Trials</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Stakeholder\">Stakeholder</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Standard\">Standard Mattresses</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Systematic\">Systematic Review</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<dl>\r\n    <dt><b>Clinical</b><a name=\"bpg\">&nbsp;</a>Practice Guidelines or Best Practice Guidelines</dt>\r\n    <dt>     <br />\r\n    </dt>\r\n    <dd>are systematically developed statements (based on best available evidence) to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical (practice) circumstances (Field and Lohr, 1990).</dd>\r\n    <p><a href=\"#top\">[back to top]</a></p>\r\n    <dt><b>Consensus</b><a name=\"Consensus\">&nbsp;</a></dt>\r\n    <dd>is a process for making policy decisions, not a scientific method for creating new knowledge.

This is a physical problem, not a psychological one. Delirium usually comes on over a few days and, with treatment, it will often improve.</p>\r\n<h2>What Causes Delirium?</h2>\r\n<p>A physical illness can cause delirium, particularly if there are changes in the chemistry of the blood, or if dehydration or infection exist. Medications, although necessary to treat illness or provide pain control and symptom relief, also may contribute to the development of delirium. Anyone can become delirious under certain circumstances of illness.</p>\r\n<h2>What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Delirium?</h2>\r\n<p>A sick person may show some or all of the following symptoms of delirium:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Saying things that are all mixed up;</li>\r\n    <li>Not knowing where they are;</li>\r\n    <li>Seeing or hearing things which are not real;</li>\r\n    <li>Being restless and unable to stay still;</li>\r\n    <li>Climbing out of bed; and</li>\r\n    <li>Having restless spells that alternate with being drowsy and sleepier than usual.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The sick person may seem irritable and angry. They may not be able to understand when people try to reassure them that everything is all right. They also may be irritable with nurses and other staff. They may be somewhat paranoid and suspicious, thinking that everyone is against them or that there is a plot going on. Some delirious people may want to call the police to get help.</p>\r\n<p>One of the best ways to understand delirium, and what a delirious sick person is going through, is to imagine what it is like to be in the middle of a very mixed up and strange dream or nightmare. The difference with a delirious person is that they are having these experiences while they are awake. 131</p>\r\n<h2>How is Delirium Treated?</h2>\r\n<p>First, doctors will try to find the most likely cause of the delirium. Sometimes this is a puzzle, and, often, no single cause can be pinpointed. The doctor may make changes to the medications the delirious person is taking. Treatment may also include measures like an intravenous (IV) to administer fluid that can correct chemical problems in the blood and treat infection. The doctor also will order some medications to treat the delirium itself, and may order sedatives to help the delirious person stay calm.</p>\r\n<h2>What Can Family and Friends Do to Help?</h2>\r\n<p>There are some things that you can do to help if someone you care about is going through a period of delirium when ill.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Talk with the healthcare team about any signs of delirium you see developing in your loved one.</li>\r\n    <li>Be reassured that, with treatment, the delirium should go away, or will be greatly reduced.</li>\r\n    <li>Try to use a calm, soft voice when speaking to your loved one or with others nearby.</li>\r\n    <li>Try placing a soft light in the room at night so your loved one can see where he or she is. Delirious people often are more restless and agitated at night because they feel disoriented.</li>\r\n    <li>Remind them where they are. If they are in the hospital, try placing a poster-type sign at the foot of the bed with large letters saying, for example, &ldquo;You are in the ____Hospital on____ Street in ____(city).&rdquo;</li>\r\n    <li>Remind the person of the date, time and season. This will help them stay connected.</li>\r\n    <li>Gently reassure them that they are safe and that everything is all right.</li>\r\n    <li>Consider developing a schedule of family and close friends to stay with the person around the clock so they will not be alone. This will help them feel secure and less frightened, and also will help maintain their own safety if they are restless or agitated. Sometimes hospitals have volunteers who can help with this. Some families will hire a healthcare aid for the night-time hours. This gives peace of mind to the family, and will allow you to get some needed sleep at home while knowing that your loved one is not alone.</li>\r\n    <li>Bring familiar photos into the room and play favourite music softly in the background.</li>\r\n    <li>Consider limiting the number of visitors who come to see your loved one until the delirium goes away.</li>\r\n    <li>Remember to look after yourself. Try to get some rest and relaxation. Go out for short walks, have a massage, or do other relaxing and restoring things. Remember to eat, drink lots of fluids to keep up your energy, and try not to drink too much coffee and other caffeinated beverages. It is not easy to be with a delirious person, even though you may understand the nature of the problem. It may help to share your thoughts and feelings with someone. Ask to see a palliative-care team, hospital chaplain or social worker for supportive counselling.</li>\r\n    <li>Try not to take some of the things that your loved one says to heart. Remember that delirious people are not themselves. In fact, they are not likely to remember very much about the period of time that they suffer from delirium, and they will not remember what they said, what they did, or what happened.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Prepared by Dr. Elizabeth Latimer, Professor, Department of Family Medicine, McMaster University and Palliative Care Physician, Hamilton Health Sciences.

Uncontrolled pain can have an impact on your daily activities and may make you feel depressed and upset. Family members may feel helpless and distressed when they cannot assist in relieving your pain.</p>\r\n<p><strong>You have the right to the best pain relief possible!<br />\r\n</strong> There are different ways to deal with different types of pain (acute and chronic). However, there are some guiding principles that nurses and other healthcare professionals will use to help you, no matter which type of pain you are experiencing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Pain is unique and different for each individual regardless of age or special needs &ndash;</li>\r\n    <li>Pain is what you say it is.;</li>\r\n    <li>If your pain is not relieved, this needs to be assessed and ways to relieve the pain must be identified.;</li>\r\n    <li>You and your family should be involved in making pain management decisions.;</li>\r\n    <li>Your whole healthcare team should be involved in managing your pain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>The first step is a pain assessment:</strong><br />\r\nYou are the best person to describe your pain. However, if you are not able to speak for yourself, your family should be involved in the pain assessment. When nurses are assessing your pain, you may be asked the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Where is your pain? Is there more than one place where you are feeling pain?</li>\r\n    <li>What does your pain feel like? What words would you use to describe your pain (e.g., aching, sharp)?</li>\r\n    <li>What makes your pain feel better or worse?</li>\r\n    <li>Does your pain move anywhere?</li>\r\n    <li>How is the pain affecting your activities?</li>\r\n    <li>When does your pain start? How long does it last? How often does it occur?</li>\r\n    <li>How would you rate your pain using a 0-10 scale? (A scale may have numbers, or may include words such as &lsquo;no pain&rsquo; to &lsquo;worst pain&rsquo;, or pictures of faces to help you describe your pain).</li>\r\n    <li>How much pain are you experiencing when resting and when you are active? (using a 0-10 scale)</li>\r\n    <li>What medications are you taking? What dose? How often? How long have you been taking them?</li>\r\n    <li>How much are they helping (using a 0-10 scale) to relieve your pain?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>What happens next?</strong><br />\r\nThe answers to these questions, along with information from a physical exam and tests (e.g., x-rays) will provide you and your healthcare providers with information to develop a plan to manage your pain. Your plan may include medication and other things such as exercise and heat/cold therapy. As part of your care, you should be asked on a regular basis to describe your pain, and whether the pain is improving. Your plan will be changed as necessary.</p>\r\n<p>Speak to your nurse, doctor or other healthcare professional when you first start feeling pain, and get involved in your (or your family member&rsquo;s) pain management plan! It is often easier to control pain in its early stages before it becomes severe.

There are at least four reasons why a nurse should advocate for a trial of heat or cold:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>it works well for some patients.</li>\r\n    <li>it works quickly.</li>\r\n    <li>adverse effects are virtually non-existent.</li>\r\n    <li>it can provide some patients/families with an important sense of control over the relief of pain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Rationale for treatment:</b> Well-controlled research is lacking, however the premise is that applying heat to skin will increase blood flow and reduce neurotransmitters, which sensitize pain nerve fibres. Heat may compete for nerve transmission with pain and therefore, in the brain there is a perception of heat and a reduced perception of pain.</p>\r\n<p>Cold works through a similar pathway as heat, competing for nerve transmission. It creates numbness in the area of pain and may be especially helpful when the pain has a burning quality.</p>\r\n<p><b>Nursing Role:</b> Assess for prior use of heat or cold. Remember that some patients may think that you are &ldquo;trivializing&rdquo; their pain. You need to be able to describe the scientific rationale to encourage patients with even severe pain on large doses of medication to try heat or cold as an adjunct to their pain management. Heat and cold can be used in children older than six months of age.</p>\r\n<p><b>Contraindications:</b> <i>Avoid use of heat in following situations:</i></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>any area that is bleeding.</li>\r\n    <li>any area with decreased feeling.</li>\r\n    <li>any injury within the first 24 hours.</li>\r\n    <li>if the person is using any menthol-containing products (Vicks, Ben Gay \tetc.).</li>\r\n    <li>within a site of radiation therapy while receiving radiation - may use on this area five days after completing treatment, provided that the skin is not flaky, red or tender.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><i>Avoid use of cold in the following situations:</i></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>any area with poor circulation (diabetic feet).</li>\r\n    <li>within a site of radiation therapy while receiving radiation &ndash; may use on \tthis area five days after completing treatment, provided that the skin is not flaky, red or tender.</li>\r\n    <li>on a wound in the healing phase.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Application of Heat or Cold:</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Heat can be obtained from a variety of sources including heating pad, hot water bottle, topical ointment.</li>\r\n    <li>Use low to medium setting to avoid burns.</li>\r\n    <li>Placement is usually over painful site. When this is not possible (too painful, open wound) other options include:\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>above the site.</li>\r\n        <li>below the site.</li>\r\n        <li>prevent direct contact with heat/cold source on the skin.</li>\r\n        <li>on the opposite side of the body (e.g. pain on right hip, place on left hip).<br />\r\n        <font color=\"#006666\">Adapted from: Ferrell, B. &amp; Rhiner, M. (1993).<i>Managing cancer pain at home</i>. Duarte, CA: City of Hope National Medical Centre.</font></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Prevent direct contact with heat/cold source on the skin.</li>\r\n    <li>Heating pad placed on a child should be monitored every five minutes and the child should not be left unattended.</li>\r\n    <li>Cold can be enhanced by using it in conjunction with menthol-containing products (eg. A535&reg; with ice bag over top).</li>\r\n    <li>When using a topical ointment, test the skin with a small amount of product to check for allergic reaction prior to using it on the painful site.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Relaxation &amp; Imagery</font></h4>\r\n<p>Relaxation may be appropriate for almost any type of pain with a goal of reducing muscle tension and anxiety. It may also be used in children of 7 years and older. Patients who are already tense and in pain may benefit from simple relaxation centred on slow, deep breathing. Progressive muscle relaxation in which the patient uses isometric exercise to systematically relax muscles from head to foot may also be helpful.<br />\r\nLengthy relaxation techniques are enhanced by a quiet environment and having the patient in a comfortable, well supported position. Listening to a taped relaxation session may help the patient to focus more easily, and become less distracted by their pain.<br />\r\nChildren over 5 years old can usually participate in guided imagery. Imagination is spontaneous and natural for children. They are able to focus easily, thus taking their attention away from their pain. However, caution should be used in using relaxation and imagery techniques in patients who are either:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>confused.</li>\r\n    <li>drowsy.</li>\r\n    <li>have a poor grasp of the language of the relaxation therapist.</li>\r\n    <li>have a previous history of significant psychiatric history, such as having \thallucinations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Distraction</font></h4>\r\n<p>Distraction is another pain reducing technique used in children. The idea is to divert the child&rsquo;s attention by actively involving him in the performance of a distracting task that is interesting and more pleasant than the painful procedure. He can choose anything of interest such as blowing bubbles, a special book, a musical toy, a magical wand (Kleiber et al., 1999).</p>\r\n<h4><font color=\"#006666\">Other Therapies</font></h4>\r\n<p>Recognize that complementary therapies such as therapeutic touch, massage, reflexology,</p>\r\n<p>Reiki and aromatherapy may be useful non-pharmacological adjuncts to pain management. These modalities should be administered by individuals with training in their application.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font color=\"#006666\">Used with the permission of the Canadian Association of Nurses in Oncology.</font></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","title":"Management of Pain: Non-Pharmacological Management","taxonomy":{"1":{"name":"Assessment and Management of Pain","weight":"0","tid":"1","vid":"1","description":"This will include all pages that are in the Assessment and Management of Pain Guideline."},"5":{"name":"At Point of Care","weight":"2","tid":"5","vid":"2","description":"All of the point of care page content."}}},"timestamp":"1269538437","error":false},"key":"pda.rnao.ca/services/json/?sessid=16f5b876d0a2b0195840cf64482519c5&method=node.get&fields=title,body,taxonomy,changed&nid=8"},{"data":{"data":{"changed":"1259268858","body":"<p><img width=\"429\" height=\"244\" src=\"database/images/laddera_0.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>The WHO analgesic ladder is intended to be a guideline in structuring the use of analgesia in the pharmacological management of pain, and is not intended to be a rigid framework.
